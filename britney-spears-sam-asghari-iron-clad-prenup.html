The singer later changed into two dresses during the reception. But despite the highly-publicized event, many questions remain about negotiations that took place before the long-time couple said ‘I do.’</p><p>According to <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, the couple agreed to an iron-clad prenup that protects the earnings Britney made prior to the marriage. So, should they break-up down the line, Sam won’t be entitled to any income she made before they tied the knot.</p><p>Currently, it’s reported that <a href=#>Britney has a net worth of $60 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May, it was reported Sam’s pre-nup demands were stalling their wedding. One source told <a href=#>OK! Magazine</a> “the talks have been taking longer than usual.” They continued, “Sam wants substantial increases for every five years they are married, should it end.”</p><p>Similarly, a second source told the publication that while negotiations were remaining “respectable,” Sam wanted to ensure he doesn’t end up “penniless.”</p><p>The same source added that Britney is “Staying out of the entire process,” and left it to her and Sam’s legal teams to sort out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam has also addressed the prenup controversy on social media. Shortly after the engagement in September, the back-up dancer turned to Instagram to confirm he’s heard the rumors and is okay with a prenup.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern about the prenup!” he wrote via his Instagram Story. “Of course, we’re getting iron clad prenup to protect my Jeep and shoe collection in case she dumps me one day.”</p><p>Though Sam and Britney’s prenup negotiations may have been a success, their wedding day didn’t go off without any hitches.</p><p>The pop star’s ex-husband Jason Alexander made headlines for showing up to her home the day of the ceremony. He was arrested on the property, but not before making his way inside Britney’s home. Jason is now facing multiple charges, including felony stalking. He’s been ordered to stay away from Britney and <a href=#>is facing a $100,000 bail</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jason and Britney eloped in Las Vegas in 2004 before annulling their union only 55 hours later. She went on to marry Kevin Federline the same year. The pair welcomed two sons before divorcing in 2007.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Suge Knight May Have To Pay $81 Million To Victim’s Family</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>OK!
