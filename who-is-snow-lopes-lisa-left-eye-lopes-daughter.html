She was born in Dallas, Texas, United States, on September 24, 1993. Like her godmother, she also took a stage name, Star Martin.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, since she rarely talks about her biological parents and family, it is not known if she is a lone child or has other siblings. However, it is known that Snow Lopes is of African-American ethnicity and also an American national. Furthermore, based on her date of birth, her zodiac sign is Libra.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Regarding the musician’s educational background, not much is known. This is because information about her elementary and high school education has remained undisclosed. However, it is common knowledge that she had her college education at the Kim Dawson Studio and Conservatory College in Dallas. She studied music and acting in college, where she was trained to be an exceptional singer.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Are Snow Lopes, Parents?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Snow Lopes’ biological parents are not known. There are no records of their names or what they do for a living. The musician rarely talks about them, and it is unknown whether they were married. However, she is widely recognized as the daughter of Lisa Lopes, who is an iconic singer, rapper, songwriter, and music producer.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even though Lisa was on the verge of rounding off Snow’s adoption process before she died in 2002, she still considers her to be her mother. This is evident as Snow maintains Lisa Lopes’s last name.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is Snow Lopes’ Father?</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The identity of Snow Lopes’s biological father has not been disclosed. However, reports say that he is a Honduran national. Furthermore, no one can be classified as her adoptive father, as Lisa Lopes was never married to her known boyfriend, Andre Rison.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Raised Snow Lopes?</span></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/lisa-1.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Snow Lopes was reportedly raised by her adoptive mother’s family as Lisa died in 2002, just a year after she commenced her adoption process. It was reported that Lisa took her in as her child before her death and treated her with so much love and care, hoping to enjoy her as her daughter. When Lisa Lopes died in 2002, her family decided to take in the little girl, as she was just nine years old at that time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, the identity of Lisa Lopes’ family member who took over raising Snow has remained unknown to the public. However, some reports have it that Lisa Lopes, at some point, took her adoptive daughter back to her mother before she died. This report further claimed that her biological mother raised her, but this has yet to be confirmed or denied by her.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened to Lisa Lopes’ Daughter Snow?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Snow Lopes’s adoption process was not completed before death took Lisa, her would-have-been adoptive mother, away. The journey that resulted in Snow Lopez being Lisa Lopes’ adopted daughter started back in 2001.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lisa Lopes often visited Usha Healing Center, which is located on Honduras’s northern coast, for her rehabilitation process as she was dealing with an abusive relationship and alcoholism. This was where she met Star Martin’s biological mother, who was dealing with some addiction problems, too.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The late singer became very close to Snow’s biological mother at the rehabilitation center. Seeing how she was struggling financially to meet her needs, Lisa Lopes offered to adopt her daughter to lessen her burden. This was what led to the commencement of the adoption process of Snow Lopes in 2001 and her relocation from Honduras to the United States.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately for Snow Lopes, she lost her adoptive mother to an accident the following year. However, some reports have it that Lisa Lopes didn’t finalize the adoption process before her death.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Speculations About Snow Lopes’s Adoption Process</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The public speculated that Lisa stopped the adoption process before her death. This speculation was raised by an article titled&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Over the Waterfall,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;which stated that Lisa Lopes truly considered adopting Snow but backed out after some discoveries. According to the article, part of the discovery was Lisa Lopes’ abusive relationship, which scared the little girl.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>An instance was when Lisa took her to a church, and the little girl stepped out of the whole congregation and shouted that she hated God. This was reported to be the major reason why Lisa decided to stop the adoption process and send her back to her mother.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to a report by&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><span data-preserver-spaces=true>CNN</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in May 2002, Lisa only took custody of a friend’s daughter and didn’t adopt her. We cannot trust the report, as it seems like CNN has taken down the post, and no other information has backed up this claim ever since it was made.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What is Snow Lopes’ Net Worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Snow Lopes’s net worth is estimated at $3.2 million as of 2023. The young musician is believed to have raised a huge part of her net worth from her career as a singer. She is also an influencer and is believed to have increased her net worth through her earnings from it.
