Among the tools available to anyone, but especially people with time and money on hand (like celebrities) is YouTube. Several celebrities utilize YouTube to promote movie trailers and interview clips, but some take to the website for another purpose: vlogging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Lizzy Capri On What It's Really Like To Be A YouTuber</a></span></p><p>Some stars vlog about fashion or makeup tips, while others just talk about life and journal their lives for the public. Some have even taken to vlogging as their new career path. Some have resorted to vlogging as a saving grace from obscurity, or to do damage control to their previously hurt reputations. Whether it's ex-Survivor star Richard Hatch giving hot takes or Gordon Ramsay giving a cooking lesson, these are some celebrities who you can now find vlogging on YouTube.</p><h2 id=rihanna-has-used-youtube-vlogs-to-promote-fenty-beauty><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rihanna Has Used YouTube Vlogs To Promote Fenty Beauty</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To promote her Fenty Beauty makeup line, the pop star began a makeup tutorial vlog in 2018. The Fenty Beauty by Rihanna channel features a show called Tutorial Tuesdays With Rihanna, where she hosts a simple, straightforward makeup tutorial video that highlights Fenty products. The debut video received over 2 million hits.</p><h2 id=will-smith-is-huge-on-youtube-and-instagram><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Will Smith Is Huge On YouTube And Instagram</span></h2><p>Will Smith has always been very adept when it comes to social media and public relations. His Instagram has over 58 million followers, and he remains one of the most endearing blockbuster actors working in Hollywood, mostly thanks to his personal, engaging touch. Smith’s official YouTube channel combines both his personal touch and his engaging method of promotion as he highlights his daily family life (another of his endearing qualities) while also promoting his projects. On his channel, we can see playful videos of him with his children, videos where he talks to the camera to hype the major events of his day, and we can even see promotional material like behind-the-scenes footage of his projects, such as his new drama Bel-Air, a dramatic remake of his magnum opus, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Have Mixed Feelings About 'Bel Air', The 'Fresh Prince' Remake</a></span></p><h2 id=zendaya-made-youtube-videos-before-she-was-a-major-movie-star><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Zendaya Made YouTube Videos Before She Was A Major Movie Star</span></h2><p>As a young teen, the Euphoria and Spiderman starlet began to make YouTube videos long before she was as famous as she is today. Teenagers with vlogs are an incredibly common, but as Zendaya matured, so did her videos. They went from your standard YouTube journal-type videos into more mature, straightforward vlogs that incorporated some playful elements. For example, a few years ago, the star posted her first reaction video where she reacted to her original videos from her adolescent years. Voters on Ranker <a href=#>think Zendaya has the best celebrity vlog on Youtube.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jack-black-has-been-youtubing-for-a-while><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jack Black Has Been YouTubing For A While</span></h2><p>The comedian-turned blockbuster movie star has been on YouTube for quite a while, and voters on Ranker choose him as one of the best celebrity vloggers. Jack Black makes playful videos about his home and family life, all of which are complete nonsense and full of jokes that fall in line with Jack Black's brand of humor. He is also not above using it to promote his films, as he did for Jumanji with Dwayne Johnson, another popular celebrity vlogger.</p><h2 id=richard-hatch-vlogs-about-39-survivor-39-the-show-that-made-him-famous><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Richard Hatch Vlogs About 'Survivor', The Show That Made Him Famous</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Hatch has fallen on hard times</a> ever since he was crowned the first-ever winner of Survivor in 2000. He was busted by federal authorities because he did not pay taxes on his $1 million prize money from Survivor, property he owned in Canada was seized and auctioned off by tax officials, he is divorced from his husband whom he was with for over 12 years, and he has now on bad terms with Survivor producers after allegedly cheating in one of his return competitions. The famous Survivor villain now vlogs his hot takes and analysis of new seasons of the show on his YouTube channel.</p><h2 id=russell-brand-slowed-down-his-movie-career-to-focus-on-youtube><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Russell Brand Slowed Down His Movie Career To Focus On YouTube</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brand seems to have traded in acting for vlogging. Although he has a role in Death on The Nile and the new Despicable Me film, <a href=#>Brand’s Hollywood career has mostly stalled</a> because he is more focused on his new career as an author, vlogger, and podcaster. Although Brand identifies as a leftist, he has begun to use his platform to promote dangerous conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and vaccinations, and many now see him as a wanna-be right-wing guru.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-is-very-adept-at-using-social-media-to-promote-his-work><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dwayne Johnson Is Very Adept At Using Social Media To Promote His Work</span></h2><p>Similar to Will Smith, Dwayne Johnson <a href=#>is very adept at using social media </a>to both promote his work and engage with fans in a lighthearted and endearing way. Johnson vlogs about everything from his new films, to his new products like his Teremana brand tequila. Most famously, he vlogs about his workout regimens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does John Cena Want To Work A Superhero Movie With Dwayne Johnson?</a></span></p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-runs-a-cooking-channel><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Gordon Ramsay Runs A Cooking Channel</span></h2><p>Plenty of celebrity chefs have YouTube channels, but none are as popular as Ramsey’s. As one would expect, Ramsay’s YouTube channel is a typical cooking vlog. The celebrity chef shares tips for grocery shopping, food storage, shares clips from his archive of shows, and yes, some of his top-of-the-line recipes as well. Ramsay is very adept at social media, and when TikTok spiked in popularity at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, Ramsay joined the app to share reaction duets to some TikTokers' cooking videos. Like always, Ramsay’s reactions range from the furious to the hilarious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>All Of Kanye West's Recently Deleted Instagram Posts</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZquklr%2B0eceoqq1lqaTCtcHBnmSvpJ%2BcwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
