Her fifth studio album is currently being worked on by Nicki. </strong><strong>This essay will discuss Nicki’s mother’s musical career and her violent father.</strong></p><h2>Where was Nicki Minaj born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Robert and Carol Maraj welcomed Onika Tanya Maraj into the world in Saint James, Port of Spain, Trinidad, and Tobago. Both of Nicki’s parents are Trinidadians of African ancestry. Robert sang gospel music on the side while working as a finance executive. Unfortunately, he was a drug addict who frequently returned home to commit theft.</p><p>Additionally, Robert mistreated his wife. The mother of Nicki took refuge in the Church and fervently hoped Robert would change. However, Robert’s mistreatment grew worse until it eventually posed a homicidal danger. After a disagreement with Carol one evening, Robert became so enraged that he nearly killed her by setting the family home on fire.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Steven Krueger Girlfriend, Gay, Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, Carol had seen it coming and had sent Nicki and her brother away to spend the night at a friend’s place. According to Nicki, Wendy Williams,</p><p><strong>“He did burn down the house. He did, it wasn’t an attempt! My mother had to leave the house at the last minute when she was still inside. She sent my brother and me to a friend’s house to sleep because she had a dream the night before that the house would burn down.</strong></p><p>When Minaj was five, Carol relocated the family to the Bronx in New York City. Carol was motivated to start The Carol Maraj Foundation through her interactions with Robert. It offers psychological and financial support to domestic violence victims. Carol wants to construct safe houses for abused women.</p><p>She gave the following counsel to troubled couples in an interview with Christian Post. She stated,</p><p><strong>“I believe honest communication in relationships is crucial for couples.” “In addition to talking to one another, you need to respect one another and make time each day for prayer.”</strong></p><p>Robert entered treatment after he agreed to end their toxic relationship, and Carol left him.</p><p>Carol expresses concern for her children’s safety during her abusive relationship with Robert in her book, Leaving My Pain. She was concerned that Micaiah and Jelani, her sons, would view violence against women as usual. She says:</p><p>The daughter then starts to fall for the same type of man after witnessing her mother being subservient and accepting many of these things. A significant portion of residences fit that description. The kids adhere to their parents’ orders. That occurs.</p><p>Nicki reportedly questioned her decision to stay with Robert despite the abuse, according to Carol. The memoir-style book also contains self-help advice. Carol was abused, notably during a serious incident in <strong>1989</strong> that included repeated hits to the head.</p><p>As a result of the numerous blows to the head, I felt blood flowing down my face, my nose was bleeding, and I was in shock, Carol says.</p><p>Carol finally left after almost ten years, using Robert’s admission to treatment as an opportunity to leave him behind.</p><p>She told Hollywood Life,</p><p><strong>“I was able to have my own small house and that was it.</strong></p><p>Robert was eventually pardoned by Carol, who never divorced him.</p><p>Nicki Minaj continued,</p><p><strong>“It took me 20 years before I could let go.“</strong></p><p>I counsel everyone to make a concerted effort to love themselves so deeply that they will release any resentment and animosity towards anyone.</p><p>Nicki’s mother desires her gospel music to inspire ladies. The goal of Nicki’s mother’s gospel music is to inspire women. Carol has been creating music since she was a small child, and she is currently working harder to get her music out there. As she stated to Christian Post:</p><p><strong>“I’ve been creating and singing new songs in the studio constantly, and I intend to keep doing so. Throughout my career, I want to release at least 5 complete gospel albums. Additionally, I intend to pen a book about weathering storms.”</strong></p><p>Carol dreams that Nicki will release Christian music in the future. The gospel community has criticized Nicki’s songs, but she hasn’t shied away from discussing how God has impacted her family’s life. She admitted to The Guardian in an interview that the church protected her family from domestic abuse. She listed her mother and God as her role models as well.</p><p>Nicki’s transition to gospel music currently looks unlikely, but Carol is confident that it will happen. According to Carol, Christian Post, “the Bible states to train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old would not leave from it.” “A seed has already been planted, so I have faith that one day Onika will sing to the Father. To God, nothing is too enormous.</p><p>After a hit-and-run accident on Long Island, Nicki’s father passed tragically.</p><p>Robert Maraj passed away in <strong>February 2021</strong> on Long Island as a result of a hit-and-run. He was struck by Charles Polevich’s <strong>1992</strong> White Volvo while he was crossing the roadway.</p><p>Before leaving the site without calling for help, Charles got out of the car and checked on Robert. Robert was taken to the hospital in severe condition and eventually pronounced deceased.</p><p>On her website, Nicki stated,</p><p><strong>“Though I can’t bring myself to discuss my father’s passing at this time, I can say it has been the most painful loss of my life.</strong></p><p><strong>“I constantly find myself wanting to call him. Now that he is gone, much more so. May his soul find eternal peace.”</strong></p><p>In response, Carol sued Charles for $150 million in the New York Supreme Court. In his filing, lawyer Ben Crump stated:</p><p><strong>“Charles was not only careless and irresponsible, but he also preferred to flee and hide rather than ask for assistance. Police acted in a criminal, cowardly, and unethical manner. He will be held accountable for his careless conduct, which resulted in Robert Maraj’s passing!</strong></p><p>The amount demanded, according to Polevich’s attorney Marc C. Gann, is surprising and outrageous.</p><p><strong>“Whether there was any fault involved in the accident or the extent of any negligence has still to be established,”</strong> Marc told USA Today.</p><p>Charles Polevich was indicted by a grand jury in <strong>December 2021</strong> on several counts, including tampering with tangible evidence and evading police by leaving the site of an event. Acting Nassau County District Attorney Joyce Smith stated:</p><p><strong>“When this defendant saw Robert Maraj lying on the ground seriously hurt, he reportedly executed a most horrible act: He just walked away. The accused allegedly went home and hid in his car after hitting the man, leaving Maraj to suffer fatal injuries.</strong></p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Steven Krueger Girlfriend, Gay, Net Worth</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>The Truth About Derek Deso And Sophia Turner</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>What Is Hulk Hogan Doing In 2022?</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqWim5ueeq61zZqhZqiRp7KvwNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
