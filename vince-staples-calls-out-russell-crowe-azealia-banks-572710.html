With movements like #TimesUp and #MeToo revealing dark truths about men in the industry, <a href=# id=auto-tag_vince-staples data-tag=vince-staples>Vince Staples</a> has raised poignant questions about the troubling incident.</p><p>For context, Banks accompanied RZA to a dinner hosted by Crowe in Oct. 2016. The two were working together for what would be the 2017 film, Love Beats Rhymes. Crowe and Banks exchanged words after a debate went left, with Banks claiming Crowe used the N-word and spit on her as she was carried out of the event. RZA later <a href=#>admitted</a> that Crowe placed his hands on the rapper and spit on her, but the news cycle continued, leaving Banks as a punching bag for critics. “Look, he spit at her,” he told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Breakfast Club</a> in October 2017 while praising her talent. “Bad nights happen. If that would’ve been something that happened that stayed in the room, it would’ve been something that just stayed in the room, but it go out.” He also went on to normalize the incident by measuring the amount of spit that was aimed towards the rapper.</p><p>It also indirectly damaged the marketing and ultimately release of the film, which fans have praised Banks for her performance.</p><p>Fast forward to Sunday (Mar. 11) with Staples, who took to Twitter to subtly comment on the Bruno Mars’ culture appropriation debate. The rapper, who’s also known for speaking his mind quite frequently, used the opportunity to question why we haven’t held Crowe accountable for his actions.</p><p>“I wonder when ya’ll gonna make a YouTube about <a href=# id=auto-tag_russell-crowe data-tag=russell-crowe>Russell Crowe</a> from&nbsp;the Gladiator&nbsp;spitting at <a href=# id=auto-tag_azealia-banks data-tag=azealia-banks>Azealia Banks</a>?,” he tweeted. “If Tyler Perry spit at Taylor Swift it would be no more [Madea] movies.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/vincestaples/status/973049572820893697</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>YALL LET RUSSELL CROWE SPIT AT AZEALIA BANKS BUT IF TYLER PERRY SPIT AT TAYLOR SWIFT IT WOULD BE NO MORE MEDEAS MOVIES. LOL BUT IM SERIOUS</p><p>— Vince Staples (@vincestaples) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 12, 2018</a></p><p>Banks went to Instagram to share her thoughts on matter while comparing the reaction she received to the non-reaction given to Crowe or RZA for exposing her medical history.</p><p>In brighter news, Banks has shared her journey back to the booth with fans by way of latest single “Movin On Up,” and a snippet of the bouncy “Anna Wintour” featuring Mel B.&nbsp; She’s also been teasing the release of her forthcoming project, Fantasea 2.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6u2r6%2FEZqqtmaChsrR5wpqjpatdpMK1edGuqqydnKF6pL7OsJxmmaqarq21wGaZmqabqHp2g5FwaGln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
