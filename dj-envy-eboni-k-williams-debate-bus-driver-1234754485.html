Williams got into a heated exchange on Thursday (May 4) over her viral interview with Iyanla Vanzant about “dating a bus driver.” While sitting in as a guest on the now BET-partnered radio show, Williams explained her stance on why she wouldn’t date the everyday worker. Her initial sentiments, which were that she would only date a bus driver, “if he owns the bus,” caused much debate online, with some agreeing and others criticizing her thoughts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Williams</a> got into <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234722222>a heated exchange </a>on Thursday (May 4) over her viral interview with <a href=# id=auto-tag_iyanla-vanzant data-tag=iyanla-vanzant>Iyanla Vanzant</a> about “dating a bus driver.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While sitting in as a guest on the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234745605>now BET-partnered radio show</a>, Williams explained her stance on why she wouldn’t date the everyday worker.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Her initial sentiments, which were that she would only date a bus driver, “if he owns the bus,” <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234701568>caused much debate online</a>, with some agreeing and others criticizing her thoughts. Later in the original interview, Vanzant declared that Williams’ ideas further add to the “unrealistic” dating standards of today.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Williams’ stance not only had the internet in an uproar, but also pushed for Envy to press her on the topic of “mediocrity” during Thursday’s show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The radio personality called her out for being hypocritical with the things she <a href=# rel=nofollow>writes in her books</a>, such as advocating “pro-Black” rhetoric to Black men while dating other races.&nbsp;He also expressed how they both are trying to uplift Black people, the difference being that he “doesn’t put people down” in the process.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“How do you talk about how much you’re uplifting and going for Black people when that’s not even what you’re looking for?” Envy sparked the debate, to which Williams, who has a white ex-fiancé, responded, “I would love to know DJ Envy how you know what I’m looking for.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">From there, Envy, née Raashaun Casey, shared that both his parents were “exceptional” even if they had what she deem to be “mediocre” everyday jobs. He then ranted how his parents worked hard to put him through college, and for that, he doesn’t look at them or anyone else in those positions as “average.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Envy then declared that he felt Williams was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234720976>“sh*tting” on the working class</a>, to which she said that his remark was “dead a** wrong.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See clip below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DJ Envy went on to stress that average workers are what keep the lights on and him booked and paid. He also expressed that <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234700196>her words offend the very people </a>who support her and buy her books. The two agreed to disagree.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ahead of the viral conversation between her and The Breakfast Club, the 39-year-old posted a video responding to the massive backlash received for her comments.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I am actually speaking and pouring into <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234661436>the ascension of Black men </a>when I said what I said,” theGrio correspondant started. “See some of ya’ll were too busy naming and shaming me personally and Black women in general as undesirable, gold diggers, and much worse.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tina-Knowles-Lawson-e1642781187669.jpeg alt="Tina Knowles-Lawson" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Related Story</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-font-family-primary a-font-primary-bold-l lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-border-a-0"></h3><p>Tina Knowles-Lawson Debunks Stereotypes In America In Docuseries ‘Profiled: The Black&nbsp;Man…<br></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She added, “Now I suspect that some of ya’ll are the same men that were bringing home C’s and D’s on your report card, only then to be coddled by parents that said, ‘Well that’s ok as long as you’re doing your best.’ Well listen, I love and believe in the excellence of the Black man. So no my dears, C’s and D’s or any other form of mediocracy is not OK.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So I’ma say it one more time, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with driving a bus — my mother Gloria drove one for years — but could it be that Black men in America have been sold a narrative of average, regular, and typical ‘being good enough’ for us,” she continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Well see, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=494803>that’s called White Supremacy</a>. In this case it takes the form of conditioning Black Americans to happily accept being a permanent American underclass.” See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m3brHNr7BmnZKku6p5ymauoqScnq6uv4ydnJuZpJp6o8HSZpuroaaav259kWxrcG1kaYV2ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
