There’s a part of me that is for me and nobody else. But in hindsight, duh, making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business,” she told Cosmopolitan in February 2023. “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy. People see the need for sides. There are no sides — there’s no winning or losing in a breakup.”</p><p>Davidson, meanwhile, has been linked to <strong>Ariana Grande, Phoebe Dynevor, Kim Kardashian, Emily Ratajkowski</strong> and <a href=#>more A-list stars</a>. His relationship with Bodies, Bodies, Bodies costar <a href=#><strong>Chase Sui Wonders</strong> fizzled out</a> in August 2023 after less than one year of dating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKajYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6rq3DnqOypl2Yuaq6xGaYqaiVlr%2B0ecinZKedp2K7psDFpaCxZaOlsqS1wKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
