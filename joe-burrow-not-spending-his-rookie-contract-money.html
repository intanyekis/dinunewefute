And Burrow doesn't plan to spend a cent of that $36 million any time soon.
  Burrow explained this while speaking to reporters on Friday (h/t Alex Chippin of theScore), adding that he's going to &#34;live off the marketing money and let that accrue in my bank account.&#34;
His $36 million contract included a $23.9 million signing bonus, and the entire deal is guaranteed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The former LSU Tigers star has several endorsements deals, including ones with Nike and Buffalo Wild Wings.</p><p>So yes, Burrow will be set from a financial standpoint over the long run. And as his career progresses, the endorsement and NFL contracts will only get more and more lucrative.</p><p>Burrow's rookie contract includes a fifth-year option for the 2024 season. But the likes of Jared Goff, Carson Wentz and Patrick Mahomes wound up signing major long-term extensions following their first three NFL seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So theoretically, Burrow could sign a massive contract extension following the 2022 season, when he'll be 25 years of age. Mahomes signed a record-setting 10-year, $503 million deal with the Kansas City Chiefs earlier this month - the richest contract ever for a professional athlete.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Chargers Sign Joey Bosa To $135 Million Contract</a></strong></p><p>If Burrow reaches his full potential, it's easy to believe that his next contract will hit well over $200 million. After Mahomes, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan carries the richest NFL deal ever at $150 million (for five years, signed in 2018).</p><p>Other young quarterbacks such as Deshaun Watson, Lamar Jackson and Dak Prescott (he's playing the 2020 season under the franchise tag) are in line for major extensions worth $200 million or more down the road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Burrow joins a Cincinnati team that has missed the playoffs in each of the last four years, but he should perform nicely on a team that includes A.J. Green, Auden Tate, Tee Higgins, Joe Mixon and Tyler Boyd plus&nbsp;savvy offensive-minded head coach Zac Taylor.</p><p><strong><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Mahomes Is Now A Part-Owner Of The Kansas City Royals</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toop%2BaeqPB0aumsGWepMFuv8%2BepZ2hnpx6qbXSZqmop5uesm6vzqerq5mTqXquu82esGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
