Like many other Hollywood stars, Bynes got her start as a child star actress on the Nickelodeon channel and was able to smoothly transition from child star to Hollywood actress. However in 2010, something seems to have completely changed. Amanda Bynes switched from one of Hollywood's biggest sweethearts to becoming one of Hollywood's biggest train-wrecks. Here are 10 of the most bizarre things Amanda Bynes has done. Now, we know there are probably more than 10, but we have tried our best to count down the top bizarre things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=retiring>10. Retiring</h2><p>The first signs of Amanda's troubles seemingly started in June 2010, when Bynes, at the young age of 24, decided to retire from acting and Hollywood in general. She tweeted, "I don’t love acting anymore, so I’ve stopped doing it." Just one month later, Bynes un-retired -- but then in September 2012, she interestingly re-retired from acting once again. Bynes stated she would instead focus on launching a career, not only as a fashion designer, but as a rapper as well. We'll see how that turns out.</p><p></p><h2 id=tampering-with-evidence>9. Tampering With Evidence</h2><p>On May 23, 2013, Amanda Bynes was arrested at her home in Manhattan for criminal possession of marijuana, attempted tampering with evidence and reckless endangerment. According to the police reports, officers stated that they observed Bynes throwing a bong from the window of her 36th floor apartment, in an attempt to destroy all the evidence. Amanda took to her Twitter account to deny all accusations and inform the public that it was not a bong, it was actually a vase that she threw out of her window.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kicked-out-of-fashion-school>8. Kicked Out Of Fashion School</h2><p>In September 2014, it seemed like Amanda Bynes had finally turned her life around. It was reported that she spent time in a mental health facility, enrolled at a school and had once again, gained control of her life. Bynes was almost finished with her first semester at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, with only one month left, and she wasn't making headlines anymore. However, Bynes was slipping down a slippery slope that the media had just not picked up on. According to classmates, Amanda would regularly show up to classes high, would never remove her sunglasses, would offer other students money to do her homework and would frequently interrupt classes by talking to herself. After she was caught cheating on an exam, Bynes was kicked out of the fashion school.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kicked-out-of-gym-class>7. Kicked Out Of Gym Class</h2><p>Back in September 2012, Bynes engaged in some odd behavior during a spinning class at a gym in Hollywood. According to witnesses, Bynes got up in the middle of the 50-minute class to find a bike closer to the mirror. After locating a suitable replacement, Amanda removed her top, revealing a small black strapless push-up bra and began biking. A few minutes later, Bynes stopped her workout again to dig through her purse, gather her makeup and leisurely reapply it in the mirror. After about 10 minutes, the instructor finally fed up, kicked Bynes out of his class.</p><p></p><h2 id=the-dressing-room-incident>6. The Dressing Room Incident</h2><p>In September 2012, it was reported that Bynes locked herself in the dressing room of a West Hollywood clothing store for nearly 2 hours. Store clerks reported that they heard a banging sound coming from inside the dressing room around every 10 minutes, and when they tried to talk to Bynes, she wouldn't come out and responded, "I need more time." After 2 hours, Amanda came out of the dressing room, acting nonchalantly, went to the register and ended up buying a few things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=drake-obsession>5. Drake Obsession</h2><p>In March 2013, Amanda's bizarre love/hate infatuation began when she tweeted, "I want @drake to murder my vagina." She later apologized via Twitter for her tweet about <a title="Drake Net Worth" href=#>Drake</a> and wrote, “I’m sorry about the tweets I said about @drake I didn't mean what I said. I hope to become friends with him instead of smashing him!” Amanda then insulted Drake via Twitter, Tweeting he has "ugly gums, uneven teeth and ugly eyes." Then a short time later, Bynes suddenly gushed on Twitter, “Drake is gorgeous.” If this doesn't indicate abnormal behavior, what does?</p><p></p><h2 id=false-allegations>4. False Allegations</h2><p>This one goes beyond just seeking social attention. In October 2014, Amanda Bynes made a slew of horrible accusations via Twitter, that her father sexually abused her repeatedly as a child. Her string of Tweets about the accusations got the attention of the masses and even trended worldwide on Twitter. Later that same day, Bynes seemingly decided to apologize to her father and her family, and tweeted, "My dad never did any of those things. The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=fake-engagement>3. Fake&nbsp;Engagement</h2><p>Also in October 2014, the 28-year-old troubled actress announced her unexpected engagement to 19-year-old, Caleb Pusey, whom the actress claims proposed to her. Amanda noted that the two met while they were at the Canyon Treatment Center together. Bynes Tweeted, "I am getting married and my boyfriend and I are going to be on the cover People magazine." Unfortunately for Bynes, Caleb was apparently unaware of the engagement. He told TMZ that him and Bynes were friends, but they had never dated and mentioned that they hadn't even spoken in months.</p><p></p><h2 id=setting-a-driveway-on-fire>2. Setting A Driveway On Fire</h2><p>This list just keeps getting weirder and weirder. In July 2013, Ventura County sheriff's deputies detained Bynes in front of a stranger's house in Thousand Oaks, California, where she had apparently started a small fire in their driveway. Witnesses reported that Amanda had spilled gasoline on her dog and had walked into a liquor store to use the restroom to rinse her dog off. Bynes returned to the driveway, started the fire and then laid down. Witnesses reportedly found Amanda laying on the ground, with her left pant leg on fire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=twitter>1. Twitter</h2><p>Amanda's very long and very public breakdown has gotten so much attention and coverage thanks in part to her Twitter account. Amanda has used her Twitter to insult fellow celebrities, make false accusations, ask the president for help and publicly document her innermost bizarre thoughts. Some of Amanda's most infamous tweets include,"<a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> was attacked by <a title="Chris Brown Net Worth" href=#>Chris Brown</a> because she is not pretty enough," "<a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay-Z</a> has an ugly face," "<a title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> is ugly," "<a title="Zac Efron Net Worth" href=#>Zac Efron</a> has an ugly face," "<a title="Courtney Love Net Worth" href=#>Courtney love</a> is the ugliest woman I've ever seen" and to <a title="Jenny McCarthy Net Worth" href=#>Jenny McCarthy</a>, Amanda tweeted, "ur ugly...u look 80 compared to me." In April 2013, Amanda even tweeted the president, “Hey @<a title="Barack Obama Net Worth" href=#>BarackObama</a> … I don’t drink. Please fire the cop who arrested me. I also don’t hit and run. The end.” Obama has yet to respond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5zKiqrWWSnseivtGeZK2gmaO0tHnAppinnJFir7q6xKxkoZmjYrGwusRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
