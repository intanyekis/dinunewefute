Known to the world as 'The Rock,' his incredibly fit physique and muscular build are paired with a shaved head and tattoos, all of which accentuate his strength.</p><p>His image is ferocious, and anyone would shy away from a confrontation with the powerhouse, and there's no question about how dedicated he is to his dietary and fitness routine. It takes a lot of work to look this mean, and this tough, but all it takes is one colleague to set the record straight about how tender and caring the man behind the image really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview, </a>Sarah Shahi reported on the true experience of sharing a set with Dwayne Johnson on a day-to-day basis, and really <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">getting to know what he's like under that rugged exterior.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rock Shares His Bizarre Breakfast Routine For Looking Ripped</a></span></p><h2 id=gentle-giant>Gentle Giant</h2><p>Sarah Shahi worked alongside Dwayne Johnson for many grueling days, dedicating endless hours to perfecting every scene. There were stressful moments, and the content of the movie is heavy and fully loaded, yet working with Dwayne shone through as a highlight to her experience.</p><p>Shahi is quoted as saying; "I’m getting the chance to work with Dwayne, who happens to be one of the kindest humans ever. And it’s admirable to watch him be the businessman and the actor that he is. "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to indicate that he treated everyone on the set with a huge level of respect and equality, and never moved his physical or cloud-filled muscles to throw his weight around or mistreat anyone. She went on to say; "He treats everybody on set so well. When he speaks to you, it’s like you’re the only person in the room." That depiction really resonated with fans, making it known that he was not a power-tripping celebrity on-set, in spite of his astounding $400 million net worth.</p><p>To all those in doubt of what a truly honorable man Dwayne Johnson really is, Shahi continued singing his praises by saying; "Everyone should take a lesson from his book because he’s quite remarkable to witness and to be on set with. He’s the real deal, through and through."</p><p><span class=related-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks To Dwayne Johnson, You Now Have A Blue Truck Emoji</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrGqv8KorZ6qXay1osCMoqusZaKarq242GajoqOVYsGwedaoqaRlp57BqXnDsJiyppVit7C0zaymp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
