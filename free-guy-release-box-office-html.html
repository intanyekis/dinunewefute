Yes, it has been nearly three decades since Hollywood released a blockbuster video game movie.
The likes of Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, Hitman: Agent 47, or the recently released Mortal Kombat all showed promise but failed on the audience’s expectations by turning out to be a flop show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Or perhaps withstanding Hollywood’s video game movie curse?</p><h2>'Free Guy' Has All the Right Ingredients</h2><p>With no video game movie satisfying the movie buffs' appetites&nbsp;for a long time, <a href=# rel=follow>Free Guy</a> might have found the right ingredients to hit the taste buds.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>First, it stars 44-year-old Reynolds, who has stormed the box office with hits like the Deadpool film series, Detective Pikachu, and 6 Underground. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actor is set to play the title character, Guy, a bank teller, who realizes that he’s a non-playable character in an MMORPG.</p><p>Guy’s world is full of unbelievable surprises, too. For instance, one day, he comes across a pair of glasses that allows him to see elements of the game like giant medical kits, player levels, and health bars - that only the players can see.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Knowing that, he goes against his scripted role as a helpless character, utilizes his unique abilities to fight the bad guys, and transforms himself into the hero for his city. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This concept of Free Guy makes it the perfect kind of video game movie one expects it to be.</p><p>The trailer also gives a sneak peek at how the movie plans to tease&nbsp;viewers with such conventions, specifically in the context of open-world MMORPGs. The film's synopsis on its YouTube trailer's description reads,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A bank teller who discovers he is actually a background player in an open-world video game decides to become the hero of his own story…one he rewrites himself. Now in a world where there are no limits, he is determined to be the guy who saves his world his way…before it is too late.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>All that being said, it is yet to be seen if Free Guy meets the expectations by bringing a new dawn&nbsp;to the video game movie&nbsp;genre. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Its Release Was Delayed</h2><p>Free Guy was originally slated for&nbsp;release in 2020, but it was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Now, after a long wait, the movie, which was produced by 20th Century Studios, and now owned by Disney, is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced to hit the theaters</a> on August 13, 2021.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Looper</a>, the movie is also likely to be released on an&nbsp;online platform, most possibly&nbsp;Disney+ or <a href=# rel=follow>Hulu</a>, after its theatrical release. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But while Disney released a hit movie like Black Widow in theaters and Disney+ simultaneously, they will have a 45-day theatrical window before releasing Free Guy&nbsp;on its&nbsp;online platform.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Bob Chapek, CEO of Disney, confirmed the details during an earnings call earlier on May 13, 2021.</p><p>Well, that’s another strategy&nbsp;to bring audiences back to the theaters and generate extra revenues from ticket sales.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6imrJus9SyZKudnJqutLGMm6axZZ%2Bbs6qvxGefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
