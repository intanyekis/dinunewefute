The trust also arranged to remove her personal items from the residence without her permission. Now, she’s seeking $30 million in damages from the trouble she says the situation caused.</p><p>Despite not being named as a defendant, Tiger has gotten his legal team involved in the lawsuits. Court documents reveal he’s seeking to intervene as he has a “a substantial, direct, and sufficient interest in this litigation to support intervention.” He’s also the beneficiary of the trust along with his two kids.</p><p>Tiger filed a response with the court, denying that he ever had a written or oral tenancy agreement with his ex-girlfriend. He also claims that he arranged for Erica to stay at a “local luxury resort and provided funds she could apply toward a new residence.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The athlete says that Erica’s decision to sue the trust and not him was a calculated move “to avoid an agreement Plaintiff made to arbitrate all disputes with Mr. Woods.”</p><p>Tiger hasn’t directly commented on the ongoing situation, but sources say he’s mortified that it’s going to turn into a scandal comparable to his divorce from Elin Nordegren. The former couple split in 2010 after Tiger’s multiple infidelities were exposed.</p><p>"<a href=#>Tiger feels like this is another shakedown</a>," a source told PEOPLE. "He doesn't want another scandal. "The insider continued, "It terrifies him […] and she knows that because they've talked about it."</p><p>"There's a lot of panic right now […] no one wants the details of a long relationship to be made public,” the source added, calling it a “nightmare for him.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> Jay-Z’s Marijuana Brand Is Being Sued For Illegal Activities</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Athletic</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqrPEq2Swp5%2BZwG610marnqqinrOqscNmmbJlmJ7AbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ2qZmtgYrqquMuipqdlnJbEtMHIrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
