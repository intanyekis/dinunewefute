I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size — we were adding 12 more soundstages.</p><p>"All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me."</p><p>In the interview, Perry addressed a range of entertainment industry issues raised by AI, and expressed concerns that it would eliminate jobs.</p><p>Perry's AI opinions were not all negative, though – when asked about his experiences with AI directly, Tyler said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours.
