The movie stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Web, a paramedic who discovers that she has clairvoyant abilities and with fate, has to team up with three girls (played by Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, and Isabela Merced) who were destined to become Spider-Woman. However, they have to stop the mysterious Ezekiel Sims (played by Tahir Rahim) from wreaking havoc and causing major destruction in New York City. The thrilling trailer starts off with Web reliving a moment when Simms attacks her in a diner and protects the girls.</p><p>It turns out that Simms has a history with the heroine’s family. “He was in the Amazon with my Mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,” Web discovers <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAyzEOeeBZw" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the trailer</a>. It’s not known if his story arc will coincide with his storyline with Peter Parker like in the comics.

In the comics, Ezekiel Sims has similar powers to Peter Parker. He inherited them ritualisticly and built a corporate empire with them.</p><p>He was fascinated with the knowledge of animal totems which caused Peter Parker to seek more information about if the spider bite was not just a random accident, but fate. Later, Sims helps Parker&nbsp;to fight a supernatural being known as&nbsp;Morlun, a vampire-like entity that fed’ on totems and another one Shantra. The beings were not in fact after Parker, but Sims himself after his ritualistic efforts to get powers made him vulnerable to outside powers and those on the totem pole to track him down. Essentially, he was causing Parker to fight his own battles.</p><p>As a consequence, he anticipated the arrival of “The Gatekeeper” and his horde of spiders who would suck the life out of him. In a twist of events, he merged his blood with Parker’s, leaving Spider-Man to be sacrificed in his place a ‘false totem-warrior.’ However with a turn of heart, Sims sacrifices himself after he sees how selfless Peter is and realizing he only used his powers for himself.</p><p>In another version of the comics, Sims had a hand of raising <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/cindy-spider-man-2/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Cindy Moon</a> aka Silk. Moon was bitten by the same radioactive spider as Spider-Man. To protect her from the Spider-Totem which dictates the fate of the Spider-Verse, he hides her in a basement and trains her powers. Parker later frees her so she can live her own life.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfoq6lrcyeZLCdkmLDqrjLmqCnZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
