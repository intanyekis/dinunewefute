This is a notion that scares the pants off people. But Arnold Schwarzenegger is not one of them. He's not afraid of death, he's just downright furious about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold is still a friggin' beast</a>, it doesn't surprise us that he isn't afraid of death. How could he be afraid of anything? Perhaps, at one stage in his life, Arnold was afraid of what happens when the curtains close. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold has changed a lot over the years</a>. But this is not how he presented the subject in an interview back in October 2019.</p><p>Nope... he's downright angry...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-angry.jpg><h2 id=arnold-opened-up-about-the-notion-of-death-to-howard-stern>Arnold Opened Up About The Notion of Death To Howard Stern</h2><p>In October 2019, Howard Stern took his New York-based radio show to Los Angeles to promote his new book, "Howard Stern Comes Again." While there, he appeared on The Ellen Show, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his complicated relationship with Ellen deepened</a>, as well as went on Real Time With Bill Maher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern And Bill Maher Completely Disagree About Marriage</a></span></p><p>But Howard also conducted his show from L.A., hosting a number of quintessential L.A. stars. And who better to have on than the Former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger?</p><p>Arnold has been a regular guest on The Howard Stern Show for years. The actor and politician has proven time-and-time-again that he has a good sense of humor about himself. This is something he definitely needs when on The Howard Stern Show. After all, Howard has made fun of him on multiple occasions even though the two appear to be somewhat friendly.</p><p>Still, Howard knows Arnold is a great guest because he is just so honest and open about his life, his darkest fears, and what it's like to get older.</p><p>This is when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the discussion of death came up</a>...</p><p>"Are you afraid of death?" Howard asked The Terminator.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No. I'm not afraid of death. I'm just pissed off about it", Arnold responded. "Especially when you have a life like we have. And then one day it's over. I mean, that really pisses me off."</p><p>Howard was in full agreement, as was his longtime co-host Robin Quivers and his best-friend Jimmy Kimmel, who was also sitting in on Arnold's interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Love Child Joseph May Be His Favorite. Here’s Why</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-arnold-think-will-happen-when-we-die>What Does Arnold Think Will Happen When We Die</h2><p>This is obviously a contentious subject, as many people claim to have all the answers about what happens when life leaves us. But Arnold seems very sure about what happens when we pass on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-jimmy-kimmle-howard-stern-show.jpg><p>"Governor...", Howard began. "Where are we gonna go when we die? Be honest with us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, the truth is that you go six-feet-under."</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>"And you're gonna rot there. Absolutely, that's it."</p><p>This gained big laughs from Howard, Robin, and Jimmy. But Arnold was serious. Clearly, they adored just how honest he was being.</p><p>"Hopefully, there is a life after this," Arnold continued."And we all know that it's going to be different if there's a life after this. I hope that there's a life after this. But it's not going to be like this. I'm not going to sit... after we're dead, we're not going to sit here like this and do interviews, and have a great time, and have laughs, and have Robin there giving us this beautiful smile."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look At Arnold Schwarzenegger And Maria Shriver’s Relationship Today</a></span></p><p>Arnold then went on to say that an after-life may involve God and a bunch of angels slapping them for saying four-letter words. Or it would just be nothingness and worms eating their corpses... Either way, it will be better and he doesn't like that one bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm so angry about it," The Terminator said.</p><p>"Me too", Howard replied.</p><p>"I'm furious about it."</p><p>"Me too..."</p><p>Then Arnold began to laugh. "You and I, we are so much alike. Because we want to be the only ones that will live forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-and-howard-stern-show.jpg><h2 id=the-rest-of-the-interview-was-equally-as-candid>The Rest Of The Interview Was Equally As Candid</h2><p>Although Howard and Arnold moved away from talking about death and the afterlife, the rest of their October 2019 interview was extremely candid. Of course, the pair spoke about Donald Trump and how much they dislike him and his policies.</p><p>Specifically, Arnold is furious with Donald Trump's policies on the environment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-death-on-howard-stern-show.jpg><p>Arnold is an environmentalist while still remaining dedicated to his Republican and Capitalist roots. He, like many others in the middle, knows that you can care about the environment while still putting people to work and keeping your economy strong and robust. In fact, the two go hand-in-hand more than people on the far-side of each spectrum would claim. In short, there are numerous opportunities to take care of our struggling Earth and keep money in people's bank accounts.</p><p>Perhaps the issue of climate change is so important to Arnold because it hurries the milestone of death for generations after him. He knows that it impacts our lives and, as he said, he doesn't want to give up the life he's living. The idea of it makes him pissed off!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Howard Stern Is The Most Effective Celebrity To Take On Donald Trump</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBurdGnpqWcXaiwqcPAq7GeppWctKa%2BjJqloKqpYq61edOhnGahlJqubrvFZpuyoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
