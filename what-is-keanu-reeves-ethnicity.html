According to Cheat Sheet, "Alice Cooper used to regularly come over to Reeves’ house when the actor was a kid." Being surrounded by people from the entertainment industry certainly influenced Keanu Reeves' decision to pursue acting.

Because Keanu Reeves has Chinese Hawaiian roots, he admitted that he does connect with his Asian background, but he doesn't speak of it often. "My relationship to my Asian identity, it's always been good and healthy. And I love it," the actor admitted. "We've been growing up together." However, the Hollywood star did reveal that he has "mixed feelings" about being referred to as a person of color. "I don't know if I agree with that statement. But I don't not agree," the actor said.</p><p>Keanu Reeves also opened up about the filming of The Matrix Resurrections, and the influence the Chinese kung fu movies had on it. The actor revealed that the movie creators remained respectful when it came to drawing for Asian cultural sources and Keanu Reeves had an opportunity to once again work with Tiger Hu Chen, who was also an important part of the original TheMatrix trilogy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Keanu Reeves Got Banned From A Market Of 1.4 Billion People But Everyone Else Still Has His Back">Keanu Reeves Got Banned From A Market Of 1.4 Billion People But Everyone Else Still Has His Back</a></span></p><p>"Chen was my teacher on the trilogy, and it was wonderful to work with him on Resurrections," Reeves revealed to NBC Asian America. "We know each other, he's a wonderful martial artist. So I feel really grateful and honored to be able to spend time with him. With the martial arts, [we're] presenting those art forms in an artful way, in a respectful way. Not in a way where it's experienced as a caricature, but from a place of reverence."</p><p>The writer of Always Be My Maybe Ali Wong called the actor an "Asian American icon." In an interview with the LA Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wong opened up about how important it was to have Reeves appear in the rom-com</a>. "It was very important to me that it be someone who was Asian-American...I was very aware that Keanu was Asian American because my family and community wouldn’t shut up about it. Maybe other people didn’t know, but I never forgot that," Wong said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, plenty of fans were confused when Keanu Reeves told Essence that he is "not a spokesperson" for Asian actors in Hollywood. The actor who is very familiar with Chinese culture thanks to his grandmother, did say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he hopes his roles are of some value to everyone</a>. "I hope that whatever opportunities I’ve had, or the work that I’m doing, in some way can entertain and can also—I don’t want to say teach—but have something of value come out of it," Reeves said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecqemKetXaeypsLErGSerJijtqS107Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
