Her foundation invests in innovative changemakers with a special interest in aiming at challenges like reproductive longevity and criminal justice reform, just to name a few.</p><p>Not only that, she also happens to be the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a Wallstreet Journal report posted in July 2022</a>, that might not last much longer. In the report, it was stated that the couple filed for divorce due to “irreconcilable differences” which occurred soon after Brin discovered the alleged affair she had with Elon Musk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# style=display:inline!important>8 Celebs Who Have (Or Had) Beef With Elon Musk</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-during-the-alleged-connection-between-nicole-shanahan-and-elon-musk>What Happened During The Alleged Connection Between Nicole Shanahan And Elon Musk?</h2><p>The report states that the connection between the two happened in December of 2021 during the Art Basel event in Miami Beach. Although it has been reported that Shanahan and Brin had allegedly separated, sources close to the couple stated that they were still living together during the time that the alleged affair happened.</p><p>Brin ended up filing for divorce in January 2022, just one month later. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk took to Twitter to air out his grievances on the situation</a> and was quoted saying that the Wallstreet Journal report was “total BS”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He tweeted out, “Sergey and I are friends and we were at a party together just last night! I’ve only seen Nicole twice in three years, both times with many other people around. Nothing romantic." In s separate tweet, Musk criticized the legitimacy of the Wallstreet Journal. He tweeted out, "WSJ [Wall Street Journal] has run so many bs hit pieces on me and Tesla I've lost count."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened After Elon Musk's 'Evil' Father Errol Was Charged With Manslaughter</a></span></p><h2 id=what-do-elon-musk-s-fans-think-about-the-relationship>What Do Elon Musk's Fans Think About The Relationship?</h2><p>It's also worth noting that Sergey Brin went out of his way to help out Elon Musk during the 2008 recession by providing the billionaire an extra $500,000 of cushioning money while Tesla was experiencing trouble increasing their production.</p><p>The two life-long friends and business tycoons have reportedly only spoken one time since the situation came to light, and during the interaction, Musk was allegedly begging Brin for forgiveness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Musk and Tesla might not find this bizarre love triangle shocking, considering the fact that he just recently admitted fathering twins with executive Shivon Zilis just shy of a month before his second baby with Canadian pop singer Grimes was born.</p><p>When criticized by the rather messy timeline, Musk embraced it and tweeted, "Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far." As of this writing, Musk has fathered a grand total of 10 children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elon Musk Welcomed Twins In Secret While Expecting Baby No. 2 With Grimes</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergey Brin's attorney wrote in a filing about the privacy of the proceedings</a>, saying, "Petitioner is a co-founder of Google and one of the wealthiest and most famous technology entrepreneurs in the world. Because of the high-profile nature of their relationship, there is likely to be significant public interest in their dissolution and child custody issues. Of great concern is that such publicity puts their minor child at risk of danger, harassment, and even kidnapping, if the specifics of their day-to-day whereabouts are exposed to the public."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Elon Musk, whether this newest drama will leave any significant mark on his already questionable reputation remains unclear.
