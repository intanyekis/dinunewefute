The season 8 cast of Are You the One? had already lost their chance at $1 million, but they still had the opportunity to win $750,000. On the Monday, September 9, finale, the final match up ceremony revealed every perfect match — and if the houseguests got it right.
Going into the finale, they already had five couples figured out."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On the Monday, September 9, finale, the final match up ceremony revealed every perfect match — and <a href=#>if the houseguests got it right</a>.</p><p>Going into the finale, they already had five couples figured out. During week 6, <strong>Aasha</strong> and <strong>Brandon</strong> became the first — and only — confirmed perfect match. However, many of the cast used process of elimination to figure out that <strong>Basit</strong> and <strong>Jonathan</strong>, <strong>Jenna</strong> and <strong>Paige</strong>, <strong>Danny</strong> and <strong>Kai</strong> and <strong>Nour</strong> and <strong>Jasmine</strong> were also perfect matches.</p><p>That meant there were six floaters: <strong>Amber</strong>, <strong>Kylie</strong>, <strong>Justin</strong>, <strong>Kari</strong>, <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Remy</strong>. Luckily, Amber/Kylie and Max/Kari had the chance to go on a date this week and Amber/Kylie were sent into the truth booth. Although they had bonded and were clearly interested in one another, they found out they were not a match.</p><p>Since that was the last chance for the house to the guarantee a match before the final ceremony, everyone was upset. Kari and Max both said they were 100 percent sure they were a match so the other four had to figure things out. Amber and Justin had a physical connection since the start, but when they all sat down to talk about their real lives — for the first time all summer, apparently — Remy’s personality clearly made more sense for Amber. That said, when most of the <a href=#>cast decided to go skinny dipping</a> later that night, Amber ended up in the Boom Boom room with Justin.</p><p>At the <a href=#>final match up ceremony</a>, everyone had to make their final decision — and they made the right ones! The cast of Are You the One?: Come One, Come All took home $750,000.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see all the perfect matches:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWv6Z52KisZqyYmnqwusRmp56qlpqwtXnMmqucoJWoerOx1Z6YpZ2UYrGqsIytn55lk5bAtXnWoqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
