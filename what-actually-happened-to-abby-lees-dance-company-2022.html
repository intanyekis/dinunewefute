As a result, many people criticized Dance Moms when the show was at the height of its popularity. Despite that, there is no doubt that Dance Moms was a huge hit since lots of viewers couldn’t get enough of Abby Lee Miller’s antics or seeing the show’s titular <a href=#>moms failing to keep their cool</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Chloe Lukasiak Has Done Since 'Dance Moms'</a></span></p><p>After Dance Moms was on the air for years, the show came to an unceremonious end. As a result, many of the show’s former fans have lost track of what Dance Moms’ stars are up to now. For example, most Dance mom fans have no idea what happened to the Abby Lee Dance Company since the show’s final episode aired.</p><h2 id=how-abby-lee-miller-became-so-controversial>How Abby Lee Miller Became So Controversial</h2><p>When looking back at Abby Lee Miller’s time in the public eye, it is clear that she has been somewhat controversial from the moment that she rose to prominence. After all, there are a lot of people who have always had a problem with the way that Miller treated her students ever since footage of her behavior was first broadcast on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite how many people disliked Abby Lee Miller from the moment she became famous, none of them could have known how much more controversial she would go on to become. After all, Miller would go on to be wrapped up in so many controversies that there is only enough room to touch on the most notable ones here.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Abby Lee Miller Now: How Her Life Has Changed Since 'Dance Moms'</a></span></p><p>Given that Abby Lee Miller’s entire job was based around her ability to teach youngsters, having one of her former students sue her for assault was a very big deal. On top of that, another one of Miller’s students took the famous dance teacher to court claiming that she created an environment that resulted in her suffering great emotional distress. With those accusations against her in mind, it makes sense that many of <a href=#>Miller’s former students may not feel bad about her recent health issues</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Abby Lee Miller, the lawsuits that were filed against her were nothing compared to the problems she would go on to have. After all, Miller wound up being indicted by the DOJ for fraud after she allegedly created a secret bank account to hide income. Eventually, Miller plead guilty to a lesser charge and wound up serving time in prison.</p><p>In terms of Abby Lee Miller’s public profile, she likely could have remained a TV star if serving time in prison was her biggest controversy. After all, Martha Stewart pulled that off. However, the public perception of Miller became toxic after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was accused of a pattern of racism</a>. Once that accusation came to light, Miller posted a public apology on Instagram but by then the damage to her image had already been done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-actually-happened-to-the-abby-lee-dance-company>What Actually Happened to The Abby Lee Dance Company?</h2><p>Over the years, there have been many companies that have gone through periods of controversy and managed to survive and even thrive. In many of those cases, however, the only way those companies could survive is by cutting ties to whoever was involved in the controversy that garnered negative press, to begin with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does 'Dance Moms' Abby Lee Miller Have Any Kids?</a></span></p><p>After Abby Lee Miller became an incredibly controversial figure, it was nearly impossible for her dance company to distance itself from her. After all, not only did people know that Miller owned the business, The Abby Lee Dance Company bears her name. Of course, it should go without saying that it has always been a bad thing for a company to be associated with an incredibly controversial person. Additionally, in this day and age, that kind of association can be worse than ever thanks to cancel culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though most people wouldn’t want to be associated with Abby Lee Miller these days, the fact remains that people love to be able to brag they know a famous person. On top of that, Miller has undeniably trained some very successful dancers and some parents who want their kids to succeed wouldn’t care about anything else. For those two reasons, it makes sense that the Abby Lee Dance Company is still running to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone who wants to have their kids trained to dance in Los Angeles or Pittsburgh, the Abby Lee Dance Company is an option. After all, the Abby Lee Dance Company has locations open in both of those cities. On top of that, both Abby Lee Dance Company’s locations have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a rating of 4.5 stars of out 5 on Google</a>. With both locations open daily, potential customers can go to abbyleedancecompany.com to find out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if the kind of dance class they are looking for is offered</a>. That said, the website seems to be having some issues so they will have to scroll down past the javascript to find the information they want.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Asia From 'Dance Moms'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6kwNSao6WxXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqKuwbJkpZ2VqHqlrc2cnGabn6K9orrYZmlpamJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
