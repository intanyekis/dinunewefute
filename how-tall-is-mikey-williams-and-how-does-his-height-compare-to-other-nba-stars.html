Mikey Williams’ height is 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm). He is one of the top NBA prospects of the class of 2023, alongside Bronny James.</strong></p><p>Most basketball players start to gain attention during the last year of their college career and only get to storm the limelight when they get drafted to join the NBA. This, however, is not the case for Mikey Williams. The young man is yet to get into college but is already famous for his talent and skills in the sport. As of when this report was filed, he plays as a shooting guard/point guard for Lake Norman Christian School located in Huntersville, North Carolina.</p><p>Born in San Diego, California, Williams initially played for the city’s San Ysidro High School before he relocated to North Carolina. He&nbsp;has been playing basketball since he was 11 months old. It became clear when he was in middle school that he has a future in the sport. Then, his exploits saw the Naismith National Youth All-American Report rank him the top player in the class of 2023. His incredible performance with the North Coast Blue Chips Amateur Athletic Union during his eighth grade earned him nationwide popularity which has sustained to date. Several platforms like Rivals, ESPN, and 247Sports have rated Mikey as a five-star prospect for the NBA. Because of this, people have taken to scrutinizing his height and other factors deemed necessary for a professional basketball career.</p><h2><strong>Has Mikey Williams’ Height Been an Asset To His NBA Dream?</strong></h2><p>Taller basketball players are known to have an advantage in the sport; in the sense that it is easier for them to reach the basket and block shots. Given that, it isn’t out of place for anyone to assert that Mikey Williams’ height of 6 feet 2 inches has been a bit of an asset to him on the basketball court. Born on the 26th of June 2004, the 19 year old is less likely to acquire more of this advantage as men are known to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>stop growing completely at around the age of 16</a>. But then, a tiny percentage of humans <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>continue to grow until they reach 20 years</a>. Unless Mikey belongs to this tiny percentage, he has probably attained his full height.</p><p>It wouldn’t be absurd for one to refuse to acknowledge that Mikey Williams has the height and reach advantage, and it is definitely upsetting to suggest it is a factor driving his NBA dreams. His height is only of little advantage to him as he is not even as tall as the average basketball player in the NBA. Above other factors one might want to consider, Mikey is a skillful and talented player; he started playing basketball when he was a toddler after his mom, Charisse, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>introduced him to the sport</a>. Thereafter, his father Mahlon started coaching him, helping Williams to nurture and polish a set of skills for the game.</p><p>Mikey has an exceptional penetration ability often followed by a smooth jump shot. He has also been praised for his fine dribbling techniques and has pulled off some pretty slam dunks which have left many looking forward to when he would join the NBA. The MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year (2019-20) broke the CIF San Diego Section single-game scoring record in the first year of his high school career: the record set by Tyrone Shelley had been in place since 2005. So, it is clear that Mikey Williams is an exceptional basketball player, his height has little or nothing to do with that fact.</p><h2><strong>How Tall Is He Compared To The Average Player In The NBA</strong></h2><p>To a large extent, the height deemed ideal for basketball players depends on the position they play. While point guards are almost always the least tall on the court, center position players are often the tallest; this is so because they are mostly meant to protect the rim and make the best of rebounds. Shooting guards, small forwards, and power forwards are typically taller than point guards but not as tall as centers. According to various reports, the average height for basketball players in the NBA is 6 feet 7 inches (201 cm). It means that most NBA players are 5 inches (13 cm) taller than Mikey Williams.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean the future NBA player would have a hard time coping in the league. If anything, players like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Stephen Curry</a>, Nate Robinson, and Isaiah Thomas have shown that height might be overrated after all. Also, Mikey plays as a shooting guard/point guard. These positions are not known to demand much in terms of height from players. In fact, it is said that the average height of point guards in the league <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>peaked at 6 feet 2.8 inches in the 2017-18 season</a>. When Mikey joins the league, he wouldn’t be the least tall of either shooting or point guards that the NBA has ever seen.</p><p>In regards to America as a whole, Mikey Williams, at 6 feet 2 inches, is taller than most men in the country. From what we gathered, the average height for men in the country is 5 feet 9.3 inches (176 cm), which means the aspiring NBA player is about 5 inches (13 cm) taller than most men he encounters. Disregarding basketball, it’s hard to think of any circumstance where Mikey wouldn’t be readily proclaimed a very tall fellow.</p><h2><strong>Mikey Williams’ Height Compared to Bronny James and Other Top NBA Prospects of Class 2023</strong></h2><p>Bronny James is the oldest son of popular NBA star, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>LeBron James</a>. Mikey Williams and Bronny are friends and the duo played together for the North Coast Blue Chips Amateur Athletic Union. Like Mikey, Bronny plays as a point guard and he is one of the top NBA prospects of the class of 2023. James Bronny is slightly taller than Mikey Williams as he stands at 6 feet 3 inches (191 cm).</p><p>Other top NBA prospects of the class of 2023 include Omaha Bielew, Baye Fall, Matt Bewley, Jalen Lewis, and D.J. Wagner.
