However, she did not expect him to respond the way he did.</p><p class=Zg>“When I went on ‘The Steve Harvey Show,’ I knew the conversation I was gonna have with my brother. I didn’t know the conversation he was gonna have back with me.”</p><p class=Zg>In one part of their conversation, Harvey told Mo: "We black out here. We can't come out here and do it any way we want to... this is the money game. This ain't a black man's game, this ain't a white man's game, this is the money game!"</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>On A Person's Character</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Mo'Nique begged to disagree, trying to stand firm in her integrity and character as a person. She questioned his statements on one of his interviews on "The D.L. Hughley Show," where Harvey revealed he edited their heated discussion to "protect her."</p><p class=Zg>She then <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bjWP2MfcjU">asks</a> why he didn't air his statements about being "pissed" that "them white boys was supposed to call me" about ending his TV show.</p><p class=Zg>“I’ve never met so many cowards and our black men in show business,” she says. “I’ve never met so many black men that have no goddamn backbone, and that bothers me.”</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Similar Experiences, Different Outcomes</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Mo'Nique's husband, Sidney Hicks, also says that both Mo'Nique and Steve Harvey have been burned by their decisions, but Mo'Nique kept her integrity intact.</p><p class=Zg>While Steve was intelligent enough to form a partnership with IMG to have ownership over his show, his winnings ultimately didn't matter when the executives couldn't get a piece of it.</p><p class=Zg>Likewise, he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bjWP2MfcjU">narrates</a> how Mo'Nique boycotted Netflix and refused to promote her 2008 movie "Precious" over unequal pay allegations, which had her with fewer projects and opportunities.</p><p class=Zg>Ultimately though, what differentiates <a class="zd d" href=#>Mo'Nique</a> from Steve was that she was able to stand her ground and keep her dignity intact.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>What Goes Around, Comes Around</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>As for what Mo'Nique really thinks about "Steve" getting cut out, she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bjWP2MfcjU">spoke</a> about karma.</p><p class=Zg>“The reaction is: are we not paying attention?” Mo says. “See, Steve, you said to the community ‘to hell with integrity, get the bag.’ So now you’re saying, ‘I have no integrity and I don’t have the bag? And now I gotta face my family?’ What you put out is what you get back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmptbW1ibXq4tMCtZLKnpWK9tsCMoqpmr5iWwW7Fzq5koJ2kYq%2Bir8pmpKimmabCb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
