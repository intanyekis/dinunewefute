Juliet Polcsa, a costume designer for The Sopranos, opened up to Page Six about how to perfectly achieve the fashion fad, which took over TikTok in January and consists of animal prints, oversized sunglasses and over-the-top glam.
“When I think of ‘mob wife,’ people are referencing Adriana,” she said of the character played by Drea de Matteo, who is often seen rocking tiger prints, “stripper shoes” and more."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to Polcsa, the social media aesthetic “has a life of its own.” (The Sopranos aired from 1999 until 2007.)</p><p>In January, <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> shared <a href=#>her take on the fad</a>, dressing in a Gucci bikini, fur coat and fluffy hat while posing in the snow on a trip to Aspen. Kardashian teamed her ensemble with knee-high snow boots. For glam she rocked pink lined lips, a soft contour and wispy eyelashes, created by her makeup artist, <strong>Ash K. Holm</strong>. Her blonde hair cascaded to her waist and she styled it in a bouncy blowout.</p><p>“It’s giving mob wife vibes,” she captioned the post. “Faux mob wife of course.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8sb7Ap6asZZOkwLXBzJ5knZ2jnrSvsdFmmaudkaDAbrDOsKVmpZ%2BXeri1xZ5kraqVo7Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
