DidosStan (Clean Version) Lyrics</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-24</div><p>(Dido)<br>My tea’s gone cold. I’m wondering why<br>I got out of bed at all.<br>The morning rain clouds up my window,<br>but I can’t see at all.<br>Even if I could, it’d all be grey,<br>but you’re picture on my wall.<br>It reminds me that it’s not so bad, not so bad.</p><p>(Eminem as Stan)<br>Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain’t callin’.<br>I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom.<br>I sent two letters back in autumn; you must not-a got ’em.<br>There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin’.<br>Sometimes, I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot ’em,<br>but anyways, F- it. What’s been up, man? How’s you’re daughter?<br>My girlfriend’s pregnant, too, I’m about to be a father.<br>If I have a daughter, guess what I’ma call her?<br>I’ma name her Bonnie.<br>I read about your Uncle Ronnie,too. I’m sorry.<br>I had a friend kill himself over some chick who didn’t want him.<br>I know you probably hear this everyday, but I’m your biggest fan.<br>I even got the underground stuff you did with Scam.<br>I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.<br>I like the stuff you did with Ruckus, too. That guy was fat.<br>Anyways, I hope you get this, man. Hit me back, just to chat.<br>Truly yours, your biggest fan.<br>This is Stan.</p><p>(Repeat chorus)</p><p>Dear Slim, you still ain’t called or wrote. I hope you get a chance.<br>I ain’t mad. I just think it’s SCREWED UP that you don’t answer fans.<br>If you didn’t wanna talk to me outside your concert you didn’t have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew.<br>He’s my little brother, man. He’s only six years old.<br>We waited in the blistering cold for you.<br>4 hours and you just said “No”.<br>That’s pretty crummy, man. You’re like his favorite idol.<br>He wants to be just like you, man. He likes you more than I do.<br>I ain’t that mad, though. I just don’t like being lied to.<br>Remember when we met back in Denver, you said if I write you<br>you’d write back. See, I’m just like you in a way.<br>I never knew my father, neither.<br>He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.<br>I can relate to what you’re saying in your songs,<br>so when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put ’em on<br>cause I don’t really got nothin’ else<br>so that stuff helps when I’m depressed.<br>I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest.<br>Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.<br>It’s like adrenaline. The pain is such a sudden rush for me.<br>See, everything you say is real, and I respect it cause you tell it.<br>My girlfriend’s jealous cause I talk about you 24/7,<br>But she don’t know you like I know you, Slim. No one does.<br>She don’t know what it was like for people like us growin’ up.<br>You gotta call me, man. I’ll be the biggest fan you’ll ever lose.<br>Sincerely yours, Stan<br>P.S. We should be together, too.</p><p>Repeat chorus</p><p>Dear Mr I’m-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,<br>this’ll be the last package I ever send your @$$.<br>It’s been six months and still no word. I don’t deserve it?<br>I know you got my last two letters.<br>I wrote the addresses on ’em perfect.<br>So this is my cassette I’m sending you. I hope you hear it.<br>I’m in the car right now. I’m doing 90 on the freeway.<br>Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka. You dare me to drive?<br>You know that song by Phil Collins, “In the Air of the Night”<br>about that guy that coulda saved that other guy from drowning,<br>but didn’t, then Phil saw it all, then later at a show he found ’em? That’s kinda how this is. You coulda saved me from drowning.<br>Now it’s too late, I’m on a thousand downers, now. I’m drowsy’ and all I wanted was a lousy<br>letter or a call.<br>I hope you know I ripped ALL you’re pictures off the wall.<br>I love you, Slim. We coulda been together; think about it.<br>You’ve ruined it, now. I hope you can’t sleep and you dream about it<br>And when you dream, I hope you can’t sleep and you SCREAM about it.<br>I hope you’re conscience EATS at you and you can’t BREATHE without me!<br>See Slim,(backround screaming) Shut up, slut! I’m tryin’ to talk!<br>Hey Slim, that’s my girlfriend screamin’ in the trunk,<br>but I didn’t slit her throat. I just tied her up. See I ain’t like you cause if she suffocates she’ll suffer more , then she’ll die too.<br>Well, gotta go. I’m almost at the bridge, now.<br>Oh shoot, I forgot. How’m I supposed to send this tape out?!</p><p>(car tires squeal, CRASH, a brief silence, A LOUD splash)</p><p>(Repeat chorus)</p><p>(Eminem as Slim Shady)<br>Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy<br>You said you’re girlfriend’s pregnant, now. How far along is she?<br>Look, I’m really flattered you’d call you’re daughter that.<br>And here’s an autograph for Matthew. I wrote it on the Starter cap.<br>I’m sorry I didn’t see you at the show. I musta missed you.<br>Don’t think I did that stuff intenionally just to diss you.<br>But what’s this you said about you like to cut you’re wrists, too?<br>I say that stuff just clownin’, dogg. C’mon, how messed up is you?<br>You got some issues, Stan. I think you need some councelin’<br>to help your butt from bouncin off the walls when you get down some.<br>And what’s this about us meant to be together?<br>That type of junk will make me not want us to meet each other.<br>I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>or maybe you just need to treat her better.<br>I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself. I think you’ll be doin’ just fine<br>if you relax a little. I’m glad I inspire you, but Stan,<br>why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan.<br>I just don’t want you to do some crazy stuff.<br>I saw this one thing on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.<br>Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid.<br>And in the car they found a tape, but they didn’t say who it was to.<br>Come to think about it. His name was… It was you.<br>DAMN!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C51KygnGeVoravscxmna1llJ6xsL%2FSrZinZZOhsqK6jK%2Bcq6uZpLtuuNiroJyrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
