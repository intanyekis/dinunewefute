Jackson recalled an example where Palmer’s alleged drinking led to her punching him in the face.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel=nofollow href=#>Radar Online</a> obtained text messages showing Keke’s apologies for the attack, seemingly corroborating his claim. The outlet documents that this incident happened in October 2021. “[Keke Palmer] and I began dating in July 2021 and broke up several times briefly before reconciling,” the suit alleges. “The final breakup occurred in early October 2023.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">His suit also disagreed with Palmer being awarded sole custody of their child and the temporary restraining order filed against him. He claims that Palmer rejected his proposal to access their child, Leodis, on any grounds or conditions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Since obtaining temporary restraining orders in this case, [Palmer] has refused to allow me any access to Leodis, and she rejected my proposal for access in the presence of a monitor,” the document reads. “I am requesting the court order joint legal and physical custody.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jackson’s lawsuit also recalls the domestic abuse incident that the actress mentioned in her restraining order. He verifies that Palmer did fall on the couch when they were arguing. He also corroborated that he had confiscated her phone. However, Jackson claims that she is leaving out important details of their relationship to win over the <a href=#>court of public opinion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He alleges that the&nbsp;True Jackson, VP&nbsp;star “<a href=#>used social media</a> extensively since obtaining a restraining order” to present “a false narrative about our relationship on her podcast.” The man claims that current and future “employment opportunities have been greatly impacted” due to her alleged false narrative.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Darius and Keke welcomed Leodis to the world in February. Since then, the relationship has hit tough times. A significant catalyst in the saga occurred when Jackson publicly berated Palmer for the outfit she <a href=#>wore to an Usher show</a>. Darius’ actions<a href=#> seemingly tore the couple apart</a> before they had a brief reconciliation in late August. <a href=#>The singer</a> would then file a restraining order against her ex, citing abuse, in November.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In his response to the restraining order, Darius Jackson accused Keke Palmer of being the aggressor in the relationship.</p><p>He demanded the court not make the restraining order permanent.</p><p>In his response, he claimed, “During our relationship, [Keke] was verbally and physically… <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/SAnnBmFTAp</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/ep5hJRVEMr</a></p>— Glock Topickz (@Glock_Topickz) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 15, 2023</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mus7XUrGSjmZOgwLC6jKScpJ1dpa6tucSrZJqapaiybrjAsKquoaRifnN%2Fk3FqbmhjaXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
