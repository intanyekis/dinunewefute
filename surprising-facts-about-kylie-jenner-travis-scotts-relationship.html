They’ve been on-and-off since 2015, and in that time have welcomed two children together. The couple are constantly the source of media speculation, with rumors about their relationship status and future plans being of integral interest to fans. Still, there are secrets about this couple that many people don’t know. Here are 10 surprising facts about Kylie and Travis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of Khloe Kardashian's Biggest Scandals</a></span></p><h2 id=there-rsquo-s-a-big-age-gap-between-them><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>There’s A Big Age Gap Between Them</span></h2><p>Kylie has a history of dating older guys, and Travis is no exception. The rapper is 31 years old, while Kylie is 25, putting a six-year age gap between the two. This isn’t a huge difference, but the gap felt larger when Kylie was only 19 when they first sparked dating rumors.</p><p>Kylie’s ex Tyga (whom she broke up with right before getting with Travis) is even older, as he has a year on Travis. Rumor has it he began dating Kylie when she was underage.</p><h2 id=travis-grew-up-in-poverty><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Travis Grew Up In Poverty</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie was born into wealth, and the Kardashian-Jenner family has only increased their affluence in recent years. While Travis is rich himself nowadays, with an estimated net worth of $60 million, he wasn’t always wealthy.</p><p>The rapper had a humble beginning. The first six years of his life <a href=#>were spent in South Park</a>, a low-income suburban area in Texas, with his grandmother. At one point before fame, <a href=#>Travis even found himself homeless</a>. He comes from a completely different world than Kylie.</p><h2 id=he-rsquo-s-rumored-to-have-cheated-on-kylie><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He’s Rumored To Have Cheated On Kylie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis and Kylie have been hit with cheating rumors for years, as recently as October 2022. Model Rojean Kar shared messages allegedly from Travis, claiming that he’s cheating on Kylie with her and other women. However, Travis has denied the allegations. “<a href=#>An uninvited person was sneaking photos</a> on what was supposed to be a closed set while I was directing a video,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Travis added, “I’m saying this for the last time: I don’t know this person. I’ve never been with this person.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Justin Bieber's 12 Biggest Scandals</a></span></p><h2 id=they-rsquo-ve-discussed-getting-married><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They’ve Discussed Getting Married</span></h2><p>They may have two kids together, but Travis and Kylie aren’t even engaged yet. However, sources have said the couple are interested in marriage, though they’re not rushing into anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>That’s not to say he hasn’t</a> thought about what his proposal to Kylie would look like,” one insider said. “Marriage is something they’ve discussed in great lengths over the years and something they absolutely both want.”</p><h2 id=and-they-want-to-have-more-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And They Want To Have More Kids</span></h2><p>Kylie has been vocal about wanting a large family, and she and Travis wasted no time having a second child after welcoming their first, daughter Stormi, in 2018. It’s likely that the couple hope to have more in the future. For example, in 2020, Kylie said she could see herself with seven kids. "<a href=#>I don’t want another baby right now</a>," she explained. "[But I] want seven kids down the line, but not right now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "Pregnancy is just not a joke; it's a serious thing and it's hard. I'm not ready for that just yet.” Kylie announced her second pregnancy the following year.</p><h2 id=their-second-child-rsquo-s-name-is-a-mystery><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Their Second Child’s Name Is A Mystery</span></h2><p>Kylie gave birth to their son in February 2022. She originally revealed his name was Wolf Webster, only to back track weeks later, saying they’ve changed it to something else. However, the baby’s name remains a mystery to this day.</p><h2 id=they-rsquo-re-notoriously-on-and-off><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They’re Notoriously On-And-Off</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis and Kylie were first linked in early 2017 after hitting it off at Coachella. Only a year later, the makeup mogul delivered their first child. Despite moving quickly, the couple gave been on-and-off over the years. They’ve broken up countless times, though they seem to have remained together following their son’s birth.</p><h2 id=travis-has-a-criminal-history><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Travis Has A Criminal History</span></h2><p>Travis has had various run-ins with the law, which many of his and Kylie’s fans may not know about. As of 2021, the rapper had been <a href=#>arrested twice and sued once</a> for causing violence and reckless behavior at his concerts, including his infamous 2015 set at Lollapalooza.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-rsquo-s-facing-750-million-in-lawsuits><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He’s Facing $750 Million In Lawsuits</span></h2><p>Travis got in trouble again during the fatal Astroworld tragedy in November 2021. The crowd surged, causing hundreds of injuries and multiple deaths. Travis – who founded the annual festival in Texas – was criticized for continuing to perform amid the chaos as well as attending an after party. The event’s organizers were criticized for not having proper security measures.</p><p>The rapper is now <a href=#>facing over $750 million in lawsuits</a> related to the tragedy. Nevertheless, Kylie has remained supportive and spoken out in his defense.</p><h2 id=travis-may-have-used-kylie-for-fame><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Travis May Have Used Kylie For Fame</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, there are some fans who’re suspicious about Travis’ intentions. The rapper wasn’t nearly as famous as he is now before he began dating Kylie. Many people believe her fame helped launch his career, so there have been accusations that his primary intentions in dating Kylie were to get a boost in his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqqgp7a0tc2gZJ%2BZk6nAbq3BqKytZZuuuaqxjKOcp6aVp3q1vsCvoKxlo5i8tcDSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
