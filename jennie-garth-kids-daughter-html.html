Although his real name was not disclosed, he went by the Instagram handle&nbsp;"@gabebregman." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Jennie Garth's daughter Lola and her date for prom.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The camera saw Lola clad in a stunning black strapless gown, paired with the perfect black heels. Her blond locks were freely flowing, and a statement necklace adorned her neckline. Of course, the prom look would have been incomplete without her corsage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As for her date, the dashing youngster was donning a dapper tux over a classic white shirt and a pair of tapered black trousers to match. The purposefully messy hair and green tie only added to his charm.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>A Proud Mother; A Proud Daughter</h2><p>If it was not clear from the snaps, Garth was beaming with pride in the adjacent captions as well.</p><p>She wrote about how Lola came to her, saying that she wanted to make her prom dress herself. However, Garth instantly realized that she meant, "Mom I want you to make my prom dress." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Being her modest self, Garth wrote that sewing wasn't her thing, but she still managed to put together what she did. She further explained how her daughter wanting a homemade dress made her proud. She added,&nbsp;</p><p>And it made [Lola] so proud to be able to say 'my Mom made my dress.'</p><h2>Garth Is a Mother of Three</h2><p>Apart from Lola, Garth is also a parent to Luca, 23, and Fiona, 14, who she shares with her ex-husband Peter Facinelli. Garth and Facinelli were married from 2001 to 2013.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In conversation with People, Garth went over her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">experience</a> of parenting three daughters who were growing up to become young adults, and in her words, "it's definitely not for the faint of heart." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Now that her daughters were no longer children that needed constant attention, her job as a mother had evolved from running around with them all day to making more subtle gestures to keep them in the right lane.&nbsp;</p><p>She said,&nbsp;</p><p>I'm just there to support that and kind of nudge them left and right to just keep them going in the right direction.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Garth Is a "Cool" Mother</h2><p>Although&nbsp;at times, she felt like&nbsp;her work as a parent was done, she had realized that being done with being a parent was like reaching the horizon.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Later on in the interview, she also disclosed that her daughters thought she was a "pretty cool" mother, and they could all hang out together.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Garth found it incredibly easy to end up in a disagreement with her kids. Garth said that she could simply breathe the wrong way, and Luca, Lola, and Fiona would act as if it was the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8mepaehlWK0or7ToWSkoZSoeqWt1KCfrZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
