And that's saying a lot, since Milano's acting credits extend back to the early '80s!</p><p>The 40-year-old, who's currently starring in the soapy "Mistresses" and hosts the upcoming season of "Project Runway All Stars," opened up — just a little — as she offered a few words about her past loves as co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover rattled off the following list of names:</p><p><strong>Justin Timberlake:</strong> While the rest of the world was mourning the 2002 demise of JT and Britney Spears, Milano admits that she was plotting to lure the singer to her side, and she managed to do it … for a few months at least. "Yeah, that's true," Milano admitted when she was asked about the "Mirrors" crooner. "That was right after Britney broke his heart, I swooped in for the kill!" Milano was 29 at the time of the romance, while Timberlake was just 21.</p><p>[Related: <a href=#>Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon Give Us the History of the End Zone Dance</a>]</p><p><strong>Eric Dane:</strong> Milano hinted that she wasn't impressed with her 2003 dalliance with the future "McSteamy." "Yeah, I had to kiss a lot of frogs to find my prince," she noted. The two met when Dane worked on Milano's show "Charmed," and even hit the red carpet as a couple.</p><p><strong>David Arquette:</strong> It happened! "Yes, I was like 19," Milano recalled. By our calculation, that would mean that Arquette, then about 20, was still a few years away from meeting his future (and now former) wife Courteney Cox. Can you picture him and Milano together?</p><p><strong>Scott Wolf:</strong> Milano and Wolf were very public about their relationship, which began when they met on the set of the movie "Double Dragon" in June 1993, and ended in a broken engagement. The couple moved in together just two months after meeting and he proposed two months after that. While there must be much more to their story, all Milano had to say was, "Yes, [for] a few years."</p><p>[Related: <a href=#>Alyssa Milano, Is That You?</a>]</p><p><strong>Corey Feldman:</strong> Wrong Corey. Milano fans know that it was the late Corey Haim who actually captured the "Who's the Boss?" star's heart for about three years while she was still a teen. When asked about Feldman, Milano responded emphatically with a "No, no."</p><p>Of course, the list of guys Milano was asked about didn't include the numerous athletes and other actors to whom she's been linked. It also didn't include rocker Cinjun Tate, the man she was married to for less than a year in 1999.</p><p>Milano married husband number two, Hollywood agent David Bugliari, four years ago. Still, she's welcomed a new man in her life since then, their 2-year-old son Milo.</p><p><strong>More Celebrity Features on Yahoo!:</strong></p><p><a href=#>#TBT: Vanessa Hudgens Delivers your Daily Dose of Cuteness</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Jennie Garth Is a Model of Fabulousness at Fashion Week</a></p><p><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian's Cryptic Tweets</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapKmowKJ5zKKjmqafYrGqv8eeqmannmK1pr6MppinsV2bvLO5xKtkn6SRorK0eZFpaGxpY258</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
