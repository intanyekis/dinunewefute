Her hometown, according to her Facebook bio, is Markham, Ontario, where she grew up alongside her sister, Talia Pitt.</p><p>Serena appears to be very close to her family. And, without a doubt, her parents played a significant role in the type of relationship the family has. They had been married for more than 25 years, until 2020, and appeared to be completely in love with each other and their children.</p><p>The Pitt sisters, on the other hand, always appeared to be extremely close to each other.

She has a charming personality, and her lovely smile and hair add to the radiance she exudes.</p><p>As a result, Serena’s distinguishing features limit not only her physical appearance but also her overall presence as an individual.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW7713762 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW7713762 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW7713762 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Serena has hundreds of likes and followers on Facebook, but it pales in comparison to her Instagram fan base. Her parents are also on Facebook, and her mother is on Instagram. Similarly, her sister, Talia Pitt, had over 1.5K flowers on Instagram until early January 2021.</p><p>So, based on her family’s presence on social media, it’s clear that Serena is active on the majority of the major ones. Serena had over 127K Instagram followers after only 69 posts. She was also new on Twitter, having joined in December 2020, but she was on the verge of building a large fandom there as well.</p><h2><span id=Serena_Pitt8217s_Career_and_Education>Serena Pitt’s Career and Education</span></h2><p>Serena Pitt was an engaging and outspoken student as well.

And, yes, Serena was one of the final four contestants for Matt James’ heart in the finals.</p><p>Serena was the youngest of the final four, but she was in no way diminished. She had a distinct personality as a whole and is a vibrant package.</p><p>Her ABC bio revealed a lot about her, and she was undeniably one of the strongest contenders. It also demonstrated how the season’s Bachelor, Matt James, would have a thousand reasons to choose her.</p><p>Serena left Matt James’ Bachelor season in Week 8. After the hometown dates, the decision was made. She was no longer in love with the contestant at the time. Serena insisted on Instagram that her relationship with Matt was special.
