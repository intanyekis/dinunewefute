The network's latest spin-off series, Teen Mom 3, will not return for a season 2. The show, featuring former 16 and Pregnant stars <strong>Mackenzie Douthit</strong>,<strong> Briana Dejesus</strong>, <strong>Alexandria Sekella</strong>, and <strong>Katie Yeager</strong>, premiered in August 2013. <a href=#>Find out which shows were canceled this season</a>.</p><p>An MTV spokesperson told Us Weekly, "MTV will not be moving forward with a second season of Teen Mom 3. We’re thankful to Briana, Katie, Mackenzie, Alex and their families for sharing their stories as they navigate young parenthood and for helping to have a positive impact on the importance of teen pregnancy prevention."</p><p>No reason has been given yet as to why the show was officially canceled, but fans criticized the lack of drama from the new cast after the show's previous series had newsmaking stars like <strong><a href=#>Farrah Abraham</a></strong>, <strong>Jenelle Evans</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Amber Portwood</a></strong>.</p><p>Reality star and mother to daughter Nova, Briana Dejesus, took to Twitter on Dec. 7 to thank her fans.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Teen mom 3 was one of the best experiences I ever had! I will never forget it!," she <a href=#>wrote</a>. "Time to move on from MTV and do bigger and better things & no I don't mean become a porn star lol."</p><p>Dejesus, 19, and her cast have frequently mocked former Teen Mom star Farrah Abraham, who released her adult film, Farrah Superstar: Backdoor Teen Mom, earlier this year. Several months ago, the cast even posted a collage of their faces impersonating Abraham's "crying face" from the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Teen Mom 3 star Katie Yeager also tweeted about the show ending, <a href=#>saying</a>, "I'm grateful for this experience. Molli and I are ready to move on from this and live a normal life. Thanks for all the love and support."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuenZ5iurC5jGxknJmemLKtscNmpK2uXai9qrqMqJ2fZaeeua15zairZqCRq7JurYysnJynnpl6tLHArKanZWJlfnR9j2ppaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
