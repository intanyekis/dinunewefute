Now, she’s taking the world by storm.
In 2017, Forbes named her the world’s highest-earning model after the then-22-year-old raked in a $22 million in a single year.
Two years prior, in an interview with WSJ Magazine, Jenner reflected on leaving her childhood behind. “I feel like I grew up too fast a long time ago,” she said at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, she’s taking the world by storm.</p><p>In 2017, <a href=#>Forbes</a> named her the world’s highest-earning model after the then-22-year-old raked in a $22 million in a single year.</p><p>Two years prior, in an interview with <a href=#>WSJ Magazine</a>, Jenner reflected on leaving her childhood behind. “I feel like I grew up too fast a long time ago,” she said at the time. “Having older siblings, you grow up around adults, so you mature more quickly. I saw my sisters and parents working every day, so I was pretty much brought up to be a workaholic.”</p><p>At the time, she had just turned 19 and was trepidatious about turning 20. “It’s the first step out of being a teenager,” she explained. “My sister <a href=#><strong>Khloé [Kardashian]</strong></a> always says to me and my younger sister, <a href=#><strong>Kylie [Jenner]</strong></a>, ‘You have your whole life to be an adult but only so long to be a kid’ And we get it. In the right situations, I try to be as immature as I can sometimes — react to things as if I were 12. You can’t take things too seriously. I just laugh thinking about my dad being a teenager, partying. It’s the funniest thing. And it makes me think — what am I going to be like when I’m 65?”</p><p>If Kendall is still afraid of adulthood, she’s certainly not showing it, confidently striding down fashion runways around the world — and pushing herself into a variety of different business ventures, including her 818 Tequila brand.</p><p>“For almost 4 years I’ve been on a journey to create the best tasting tequila. After dozens of blind taste tests, trips to our distillery, entering into world tasting competitions anonymously and WINNING … 3.5 years later I think we’ve done it!” <a href=#>Kendall wrote via Instagram in February 2021</a>, three months before launching 818 Tequila. “This is all we’ve been drinking for the last year and I can’t wait for everyone else to get their hands on this to enjoy it as much as we do! @drink818 coming soon.”</p><p>Kendall received an outpouring of love from her family ahead of the launch, including sister Kylie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“KENDALL!!!!! yes!!! I’ve seen all the hard work and LOVE you’ve put into 818!!! and u did it … the best tequila !!! proud of u,” she commented on the announcement post.</p><p>Scroll down to see photos of Kendall’s life in the spotlight, starting with one of her first red carpet appearances with her famous family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa6w5qjpWWamruvsdFmq6Gqn6q0qXnToZxmsZWWv7R5x56pZqSZm7Jutc1mp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
