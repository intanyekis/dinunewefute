It describes how the lens renders the out-of-focus points of light, creating a soft and pleasing background that helps isolate the subject and adds depth to the photo. Bokeh is often characterized by its shape, which can be round or polygonal depending on the design of the lens aperture.</p><p>Bokeh is highly valued in photography as it can enhance the visual appeal of an image and create a sense of atmosphere. Photographers often use lenses with wider apertures, such as f/1.8 or f/1.4, to achieve a shallower depth of field and maximize the bokeh effect. Different lenses produce different bokeh qualities, and photographers may choose specific lenses based on their preferred bokeh characteristics.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Examples_of_lenses_known_for_their_bokeh></span>Examples of lenses known for their bokeh:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Nikon 85mm f/1.4G</li><li>Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM</li><li>Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tips_for_achieving_beautiful_bokeh></span>Tips for achieving beautiful bokeh:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Use a lens with a wide aperture.</li><li>Select a background with interesting lights or shapes.</li><li>Position your subject in front of the background at an appropriate distance for desired blur.</li><li>Experiment with different focal lengths and distances to control the depth of field.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_bokeh_important_in_photography></span>Why is bokeh important in photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bokeh plays a crucial role in drawing attention to the main subject of a photograph.
