Back in the day, she found inspiration in Lauryn Hill's performance in 'Sister Act 2.' Seeing one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest hip-hop acts of the 2000s</a> inspired her, and Colbie decided she wanted to pursue singing.</p><p>She started vocal lessons at age 11, but it wasn't until she was 19 that Colbie recorded her first song and made an attempt at a career in music.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Mark McGrath From Sugar Ray Has Been Up To</a></span></p><p>Her first attempts didn't go well, though; Colbie auditioned for 'American Idol' twice but was rejected, notes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>. So how did the artist get to the point of topping the charts and having future 'Idol' contestants singing&nbsp;her songs as they auditioned?</p><p>MySpace was Colbie's claim to fame. While most fans were freaking out over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some popular rock bands of the 2000s</a>, Colbie found tamer fans online. One of the original songs she penned and performed at the 'Idol' audition — "Bubbly" — was uploaded to the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was catchy, cool, and everything MySpacers loved back in the day.&nbsp;All Music explained that after just a few days, the song was getting millions of hits, and she was the platform's number one unsigned artist for four months.</p><p>After that, Colbie had no trouble nabbing a record deal with Universal Republic.</p><p>Colbie's first album "Coco" came out in 2007, and she's released five other studio albums since then (the last one in 2016). She's performed with John Mayer and Gavin DeGraw over the years, and she's&nbsp;won awards like the Billboard Music Award for Rising Star and two Grammys for&nbsp;Album of the Year, among other high-level honors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And though Caillat isn't making headlines for relationship drama (she recently ended a 10-year relationship with fellow musician Justin Young yet the two still write and record music together) or anything else controversial, she's kept up creating music for the last decade.</p><p>She does tons of charity work, and according to Instagram, she splits time between Tennessee and Hawaii. But in addition to Colbie's personal album releases, she also got together with her former beau and some other creatives in 2018. The group released music under the band name Gone West and performed at the Grand Ole Opry before disbanding mid-2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's 35 now, but Colbie is still the same "bubbly" artist that she was in her MySpace days, and arguably far more successful. A net worth of over $9 million is not a bad outcome for a star who grew to fame on MySpace.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's The Tragic Story Of What Happened To The '90s Boy Band LFO</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKoo5uhlWKworXLpZitZZSktq%2BzjKemsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
