The boy got his “Carlton” middle name from his paternal grandfather, and is reportedly affectionately known as “Kit” by his parents. In an interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> in 2015, Benedict shared how becoming a parent has affected him. “For years, I assumed my parents to be one thing, but when you have children yourself your perception of them changes, as does the things they have done over the years.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He went on, “You interpret events and actions differently and take a much deeper understanding of what it is they did for you and went through for you.

When appearing on&nbsp;Live With Kelly and Ryan&nbsp;in 2016, Benedict noted how he and his wife Sophie were preparing for baby number two.&nbsp;“They say it takes a village for one and it probably takes a city for two,” he laughed about preparing for his second child, saying that he and Sophie were prepared for the young one “as much as you can be” and noted how “exciting” the news of the forthcoming child was.</p><h2><strong style="font-family:-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,segoe ui,Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,helvetica neue,sans-serif"><strong style="font-family:playfair display;font-size:30px;font-style:italic"><strong>Finn Cumberbatch&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Finn Cumberbatch was born in 2019. Much like his older brothers, Benedict and Sophie have kept their child out of limelight, focusing on keeping the family structure tight and keeping things low-key.&nbsp;“Having a baby ― it’s massive. And on a very unexpected level. Suddenly I understood my parents much more profoundly than I ever had before,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue UK</a>&nbsp;in 2016. “I was expecting, with ‘Hamlet,’ that it might be a hindrance to be a father, because it’s all about being a son. But it’s the opposite. You understand much more about being a son, becoming a father.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GepZ6cmZjBbq%2FUppmeqpKWwaS0jKSgnatdaYNxf5Zta2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
