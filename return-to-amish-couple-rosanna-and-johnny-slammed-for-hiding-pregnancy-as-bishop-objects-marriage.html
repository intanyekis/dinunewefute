Rosanna's baby bump seems to be too obvious in the episode. Seeing it, many speculated the due date to be almost on the edge. However, the couple were accused of hiding the pregnancy. But, the repercussions of hiding the fact came in the form of a bishop disapproving of their relationship.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Return to Amish' fans call Jethro Nolt 'selfish' as he reveals shocking reason for leaving Sabrina Burkholder</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Is Ada falling in love?

Listening to the news Johnny jumped in happiness and wanted to marry his girlfriend right away. But in order to do so, the couple needed the bishop's approval. As they went to visit the bishop, Johnny was asked a harsh question about premarital sex. Bishop knew the couple were in Florida for the past few days and might have done tempted by sin. However, Johnny refused to say either yes or no to the question asked by the bishop. Not getting any reply from Johnny made the bishop refuse to give permission for their marriage. The bishop further claimed that Rosanna was "not good enough" for Johnny. He doubted Rosanna's chastity. On the other hand, the bishop did not question Johnny's purity. This hinted that Rosanna might get shunned by the Amish community in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/38ef78ff-fd28-42f7-a8c2-8a2cf50ac108.png><h2 class=split>'The lies would come back to bite Johnny and Rosanna'</h2><p>Seeing Rosanna in the recently released episode, a fan claimed, "Roseanna look like she bout due. How are they tryna hide that??" A fan uploaded a heartbroken emoji as he wrote the Bishop's words, "In my eyes, I do not approve of this relationship." Seeing Rosanna and Johnny allegedly lie about not knowing the pregnancy soon a fan tweeted, "The lies would come back to bite Johnny and Rosanna in the form of the bishop denying their relationship!" "Gossip in the Amish community travels quickly. Everyone hears almost everything," a fan tweeted knowing that one day or the other Amish community will get to know about Rosanna's pregnancy no matter how hard she tried to hide.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Roseanna look like she bout due.
