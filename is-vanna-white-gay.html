Greer recounted an incident where White invited her over while her then-fiancé was away, and they had an intimate encounter.</p><p>In a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">RadarOnline</a>, Liza Greer said, “We were lesbian lovers and did what two people do in a bedroom. I<span>&nbsp;had sex with her, obviously. It was pretty wild.”</span></p><p>However, it’s crucial to note that this isolated incident does not define someone’s sexual orientation. Vanna White has only publicly dated men throughout her life, and there have been no other substantiated reports of same-sex relationships.</p><p>At 66 years old, her dating history predominantly consists of relationships with men, which provides a clear indication of her heterosexual orientation.</p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Jason Kelce Gay?

In the 1980s, she dated and became engaged to John Gibson, who was not only a Playgirl magazine centerfold but also a Chippendales dancer who later pursued an acting career.</p><p>Tragically, Gibson lost his life in a plane crash in 1986. In 1990, Vanna White tied the knot with George Santo Pietro, a restaurant owner.</p><p>Their journey into parenthood began in September 1992 when White became pregnant. An episode of Wheel of Fortune even featured the answer “Vanna’s pregnant” as a puzzle.</p><p>However, she sadly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suffered a miscarriage</a> shortly after the episode was taped. White and Santo Pietro welcomed a son named Nicholas (often called Nikko) in 1994 and a daughter named Giovanna (nicknamed Gigi) in 1997.</p><p>Despite the initial joys of their family, the couple eventually divorced in November 2002.</p><p>Following her divorce, Vanna White was engaged to Southern California businessman Michael Kaye from 2004 to 2006, although they never made it to the altar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2LDorrNmmSwoJmpsm6zwLJmbHBpaYZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
