I didn’t get a chance to be a h** and do all that sh*t. So you know trying to date at 40 and do h** sh*t, it just don’t work. You can’t do the same h** sh*t. These bi**es out here, they’re h**ing to another level. I’m trying to h** with this old pu**y. They’re like, ‘We don’t want that sh*t!’”</p><p>Previously, Torrei shared that she’s had a few subpar dates with men&nbsp;who try to force her to laugh. “Some men I went on a date with, I could tell they’re trying to be funny,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>. “And if that’s not who you are, be who you are because that’s a problem.” With both her and Hart’s schedules within their respective careers,&nbsp;she shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CocoaFab</a> that their co-parenting skills relies heavily on communication and understanding.</p><p>“We have to stay in one accord and communicate,” she said. “I’m just a stickler for that and it’s good he’s the same way. It works for us. We both realize it’s about the children and so we make it work.” On Saturday (June 23), <a href=# id=auto-tag_torrei-hart_1 data-tag=torrei-hart>Torrei Hart</a> will perform another set at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Comedy Block Party</a> just in time for the BET Awards weekend lineup of events.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8s77EomShmaKpeqyx1aKlZqCRp8FusddmrqKelWKxosDIp55mm5%2BisqXFjKycrWVlbn94f5do</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
