The news first got out on March 16 of 2017.</p><p><strong>Caption: Pilar Sanders and Odell spotted together in Paris attending Drake’s concert together.</strong></p><p>Now, we know how Odell is no.1 homie of Drake’s but what Pilar was doing there too is beyond our wit. We could say she was just casually attending the concert. Although, she sure is snuggling up to Odell in the video. Terezo Owens father claims that,</p><p>“Pilar really likes Odell’s energy; she enjoys spending time with him, makes her feel young and alive.”</p><p>We do hope that this is a new beginning for Pilar Sanders.

Deion was given the custody of their children after their divorce.</p><p>On the issue of their divorce, Deion was spotted claiming,</p><p>“Pilar and I have decided to end our marriage and move on to the next phase of our individual lives with mutual respect. We are friends and our top priority has and will continue to be the well-being of our children. We arrived at this decision prayerfully and carefully in order to be able to pursue what is in both of our best personal interests.”</p><p>Although they agreed on being civil with each other, they kept on indulging themselves in petty feuds. In 2014, Deion filed for another case in court for violating divorce rules which caused Pilar to lose the visitation rights of her kids.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pilar_on_Social_Medias></span>Pilar on Social Medias<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pilar who is also active on Social networking sites like to flaunt her kids and also is really happy of being a proud mom as of her <a href=#>Instagram</a> feeds.</p><p>In 2016 again, Deion charged Pilar with another defamation case because Pilar took it to social media about Deion physically abusing Pilar.
