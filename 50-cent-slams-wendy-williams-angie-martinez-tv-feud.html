That sh*t supposed too (sic) only be on radio. We ain’t supposed to have to look at sh*t like this. LOL.” While Fiddy didn’t specifically name Wendy, it’s kind of obvious that this massive shade was all about her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After all, this insult came just hours after 50 declared war on Wendy (after she took a shot at him on her television show.) He launched his first attack on Oct. 13, sharing that now-infamous picture of her in a black bikini while saying she was an “ugly mother**ker” and that her husband deserved to have a “side chick.” He followed it up by posting a side-by-side of her and <strong>Ron Perlman</strong>, 67, in his makeup for the 1987 television adaption of Beauty and the Beast. Needless to say, 50 wasn’t calling Wendy a “beauty.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Yikes. It’ll be interesting to see if Angie joins 50’s feud. She has her own long-standing beef with Wendy, one she detailed in her memoir, My Voice. Angie claims that she even threw a punch at Wendy in 1997, after she made fun of Angie’s relationship with rapper <strong>Q-Tip. </strong>“One of my co-workers is dating Q-Tip from <strong>A Tribe Called Quest</strong>,” Wendy wrote on her website at the time, taking a shot at Angier’s relationship. “I guess some women like men who like men.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After several attempts to talk it out, Angie confronted Wendy and it got ugly. “I lost my f–king mind,” Angie wrote in her book, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>. “Before I knew it I was swinging at her. It was a quick scuffle. It took only a few seconds for me to realize that she wasn’t really hitting me back — she was just trying to get me off of her.” Huh. No wonder Wendy reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lost her mind</a> when Angie supposedly inked her own daytime talk show deal. Maybe 50 is going to get his wish and the Angie Martinez Show will be on the air soon?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Should Angie join 50’s war on Wendy, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Or should she stay out of it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH5xe5BtZm5oXZiyr8CMrKOapaNixKa6w7JksKGcobaiudJmmKefmZp6rq3RraCnnapiwbd5xZ6snWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
