It is not terrible because it is huge and takes up his entire back but rather because it is so unclear what the heck the drawing is. The tat appears to be some sort of giant rainbow-colored phoenix-like thing, but seriously we could be completely wrong with that analysis.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>ACTORS THAT SHOULD REPLACE BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN</a></strong></p><p>Social media has been buzzing about the extra large back tattoo on the Oscar winner. Let’s just say people are not a fan and it is easy to see why. It is seriously not that the ink covers most of his back; the design just doesn’t make any sense. There are people who have their entire bodies covered in tattoos and they look awesome. That is so not the case of Affleck’s back tattoo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Twitter users were not holding back about their true feelings regarding the actor’s permanent artwork.</p><p>“I wish I could unsee Ben Affleck's back tattoo. It looks like a rejected album cover for Coldplay,” Tweeted @elyse_faulk</p><p>“Next time you're feeling sad, remember that you're not Ben Affleck so you (probably) don't have a tattoo so big and so ugly and so universally ridiculed that you had to lie and say it was only temporary and just for a movie when it is so clearly not,” shared @RafiDAngelo</p><p>Perhaps the reason the actor denied he had a massive back that is because he actually realized it was freaking ugly. Maybe he is embarrassed by so he denied it for so long. Who knows but it is his body and he can do whatever he wants to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What do you think about Ben Affleck’s massive back <a href=#>tattoo</a>, is it a hit or a miss?</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>HOW BEN AFFLECK & MATT DAMON ARE MAKING THEIR MOVIES MORE DIVERSE</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nkpq7bq3Fn6Oem5tir6KvymarmqykpLxuvsSao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
