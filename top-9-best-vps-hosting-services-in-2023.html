In VPS hosting, the physical server is partitioned into multiple virtual servers, each with its own dedicated resources, including CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.</p><p>Each virtual server in a VPS hosting environment runs its own operating system and has root access, which means that you have complete control over your server and can install any software, applications or scripts that you need. This makes VPS hosting an ideal choice for businesses that need more control and flexibility over their hosting environment, but don’t want to invest in a dedicated server.</p><p>VPS hosting is often used for websites that have outgrown shared hosting, but don’t require the resources of a dedicated server. It is a cost-effective solution that offers the scalability and flexibility of a dedicated server, without the high costs and technical complexities associated with managing a dedicated server.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
