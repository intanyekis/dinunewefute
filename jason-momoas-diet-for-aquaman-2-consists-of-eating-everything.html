“I don’t do calories,” Momoa, 44, told E! News on Friday, December 15, while opening up about the fitness routine he followed before filming Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. “I just eat … everything.”
Momoa continued, “You’re burning so many calories, I just eat and consume. I’m constantly moving and work long days. I just shovel it in, and then work hard."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

News</a> on Friday, December 15, while opening up about the fitness routine he followed before filming Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. “I just eat … everything.”</p><p>Momoa continued, “You’re burning so many calories, I just eat and consume. I’m constantly moving and work long days. I just shovel it in, and then work hard. Work hard, eat hard, play hard, just do it.”</p><p>The actor explained that he doesn’t “really” follow a workout routine for vanity, but more so that he doesn’t get injured on set. “You’ve got to be prepared,” he said. “You’re putting on a suit that’s going to weigh 40 pounds. You’ve got to be able to move. That kind of action just puts a lot of weight on your knees. So, you just do it so you don’t get hurt.”</p><p>When the movie hits theaters on Friday, December 22, fans can look forward to seeing the superhero take on the role of being a dad. (In the sequel, Aquaman is married to Mera, <a href=#>played by <strong>Amber Heard</strong></a>, and has a son, Arthur Curry Jr., more commonly known as Aquababy.)</p><p>While speaking to E! News, Momoa gushed about playing a father, saying, “I’m like, ‘People need to see this side of him,’ so that was my request, and I think people are going to really love it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jason-Momoa-Eats-Everything-While-Playing-Aquaman-2.jpg><p>In his personal life, Momoa is a proud dad of two. He shares daughter Lola Iolani, 16, and son Nakoa-Wolf, 14, with ex <strong>Lisa Bonet</strong>. (Bonet, 56, is also the mom of<strong> Zoë Kravitz</strong>, 35, whom she shares with ex <strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong>.)</p><p>In August 2021, Momoa opened up to<a href=# rel=noopener> Vogue</a> about being a dad.</p><p>“There’s no other way to express what it really <a href=#>feels like to be a father</a>, to be willing to do anything in the world for someone other than yourself,” he said, adding, “It’s a beautiful thing to be a parent. I am really close to both my kids, but it’s also different with daughters, it’s just way more nurturing.”</p><p>Through the years, Momoa has taken his kids to a number of red carpet events, including the James Bond: No Time to Die premiere in 2021, a Slumberland screening in 2022 and more.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the Slumberland premiere, Lola revealed to E!
