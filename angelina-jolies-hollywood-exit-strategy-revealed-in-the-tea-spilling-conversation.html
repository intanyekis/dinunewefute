The catalyst? Her divorce from Brad Pitt and the ensuing legal whirlwind.</p><p>Reflecting on her journey, Jolie aired her grievances about the perils of being under the paparazzi microscope. “When I started out, I didn’t sign up for a worldwide live stream,” she shared.</p><p>Being a Hollywood kid, she didn’t quite buy into the glitz and glam. “I’ve always seen through the smoke and mirrors,” she quipped, hinting at her disillusionment with La La Land.</p><p>Blaming the aftermath of her breakup for her eagerness to pack her bags, she admitted, “I lost my ability to ghost and globe-trot independently.”</p><p>Her heart’s set on a great escape when the coast is clear. Why? Well, according to her, Hollywood is a bit like that famous soufflé – looks fab but doesn’t do wonders for your health.</p><p>The confession didn’t end there. Jolie spilled that her social life is a bit of a unicorn these days and made it clear that her current relationship status is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Her squad? Well, her kids are the VIPs in her inner circle.</p><p>For those tuning in late, Jolie and Pitt’s love story kicked off in 2004 on the set of “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.” Fast forward through ten years of coupledom, a lavish wedding in 2014, and cue the dramatic exit music in 2016, making their divorce headline news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Angelina-Jolie-2-1024x576.jpg><p>But this isn’t just about her Hollywood exit; it’s also a time-travel journey to Jolie’s Hollywood inception. She told WSJ Magazine she might have been crooning Broadway tunes instead of pursuing movie stardom if the present-day scene were her 1990s playground.</p><p>The game of fame has evolved, and the rules now? Think of the pressure dial cranked up to eleven. Back in her day, it was a different ball game—one that didn’t involve Instagramming breakfast.</p><p>Growing up with Hollywood royalty as parents, Jolie’s take on Tinseltown’s shine was, well, a bit dim. The glitter and gold didn’t sway her; she considered it all rather shallow. So, Hollywood, it’s not you; it’s her. Seeking authenticity seems to be her game plan.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t blame Angelina Jolie for leaving Hollywood, All the hell Angie and her kids went through at the hands of that piece of shit Brad Pitt. Hollywood loves to protect abusers and black balled victims <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#BradPittIsAnAbuser</a></p>— *NSYNC’s back alright (@imjustshar) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">December 6, 2023</a><p>In a tell-all to Vogue, Jolie unveiled her low-key acting strategy since 2016 for the sake of her mental well-being. She admitted, “I’ve been in an identity crisis for a decade. Not fun.” Hollywood’s spotlight hasn’t been her BFF lately, prompting a quest for her true self.</p><p>Jolie’s Hollywood farewell isn’t just an exit; it’s a mic-drop moment. It’s a tale of one star choosing peace of mind over the frenzy of fame.</p><p>From red carpets to seeking serenity, her narrative’s gone from Hollywood plot twists to a saga of personal growth and tranquility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51ktbC4y7KuqKeUZK6vs8SloKeZXZ%2B8rbXErGShp5yhxri7zp1knrCZqXq0wNGaq56fqWK%2FpsLEmqOenF2eu27Ax55krZ2RYsCxtculoKefXZi8r8LEq6qarJmku3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
