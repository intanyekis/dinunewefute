It ended with three passes in three seconds, including an alley-oop from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Al Horford</a> to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Robert Williams</a>.</p><p>The size. The intelligence. The chemistry. In that one connection Wednesday night, the Boston starters showed off much of what makes them such a dangerous group. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jayson Tatum</a> could have tried to take <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cleveland</a> center <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jarrett Allen</a> off the dribble but noticed Horford cutting free into the paint. Even before catching the ball, Horford seemed to know he would throw it immediately to Williams. Horford tossed the pass well above the rim, but Williams still had no problem rising up to slam it through the rim.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rob Lob to fire up the crowd early 🔨 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S5dQuA1s75</a></p><p>— Boston Celtics (@celtics) <a href=#>March 2, 2023</a></p><p>The Celtics haven’t benefited from complete health frequently but have been close to it several times recently, like they were during Wednesday night’s 117-113 win against Cleveland. With everyone available except <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Danilo Gallinari</a>, who has missed the entire season with a torn ACL, Boston saw both the upside and downside of an otherwise full roster.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>The upside</h2><p>Thanks to a series of injuries, the Celtics starting lineup had played only 53 minutes together entering the night. That group, one of the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NBA</a>’s most productive units last season, hasn’t had many chances to duplicate the magic this time around. First Williams got injured. Then <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marcus Smart</a> missed substantial time. The Celtics starters were all available during the first two games after the All-Star break, but <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylen Brown</a> missed Monday night’s loss to New York for personal reasons, breaking up the lineup again.</p><p>Brown’s return Wednesday made the Celtics’ first unit whole again. The starters held their own in the first quarter before taking control at the beginning of the third. Before the first substitution of the second half, Boston’s starters went on a 16-7 run to extend the team’s lead to 71-59. During that stretch, the Celtics held Cleveland to 3-for-11 shooting without any offensive rebounds. The latter number pleased Williams.</p><p>“Every time I see anybody get a rebound I kind of take it personal,” Williams said. “That’s where they were killing us at, second-chance points is where they were getting most of their points in the first half.”</p><p>Though the Celtics have been outscored with all of their starters on the court this season, there’s no reason to believe that trend will last as the sample size grows. They were dominant as a unit last season, especially at the defensive end of the court, and all five players are playing at a high level individually. Other lineups with Horford and Williams have shut down opposing offenses much like they did last season.</p><p>“It’s a new year,” Brown said. “But when we’re all on the same page, we’re all healthy, I feel like we’ve got a good chance to win any ballgame.”</p><p>The Celtics didn’t just win with defense. Against the league’s third-ranked defense, they shot 50 percent from the field, including a matching 50 percent from behind the 3-point arc. Tatum delivered his best game since the All-Star break with 41 points, including 18 in the third quarter. Horford (23 points) made his first eight shots, including six 3-point attempts, before finally missing one. Williams, who had only blocked three shots over his previous six games, broke up several of Cleveland’s plans while racking up 11 points, 11 rebounds, two blocks and one steal. He also made all four of his shot attempts. Smart shot just 3-for-11 from the field but wrecked several Cleveland possessions with his defense. Brown scored only 16 points on 6-for-15 shooting, but Joe Mazzulla credited him and Tatum for creating much of the Celtics’ offensive flow.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“(Tatum) took what the defense gave him, he was aggressive, and when he got into the paint, he made the right play,” Mazzulla said. “So he did that. I thought Jaylen did a great job with the same thing. I thought Jaylen really controlled the pace of the game when he had the ball, made the right play, made some big plays for us. And so when those two guys are locked in on taking what the defense gives them and making the right play, we’re a great team.”</p><p>The Celtics looked like a great team Wednesday, but being on a great team forces players to sacrifice.</p><h2>The downside</h2><p>Though a loaded roster is far from the worst problem to have, Mazzulla will need to make decisions on who to play and when. He went away from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Grant Williams</a> on Wednesday, giving the forward his first DNP-CD since the 2020-21 season. When asked why, Mazzulla initially just said, “Matchups.”</p><p>“Just matchups on the offensive end, as far as spacing the floor and having rim protection,” Mazzulla said when asked for further explanation. “And so when Mike (Muscala) was in, we were able to play a different defensive lineup. Didn’t want to switch these guys as much in that second unit.”</p><p>Williams, averaging 27.3 minutes per game, had played at least 16 minutes in every previous game but two. Instead of turning to him, as they usually do, the Celtics went with Muscala at center and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sam Hauser</a> at power forward off the bench.</p><p>“For Grant, just keep his head,” Brown said. “Grant, he knows what he brings to this team and the type of player he is. He’s been able to carve value out in this league, so a couple games here and there based upon whatever the coaching staff thinks doesn’t mean any more or less. Grant has helped us win playoff games. Grant has helped us get to the finals last year. So obviously, we’re going to need him. So keep his head, he’s gonna be aight. He’s a professional, so we just gotta keep moving forward.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Williams’ DNP was the latest sign the Celtics have difficult rotation choices to make now that they are at full health with the exception of Gallinari. When Mazzulla goes small, will he close with Horford or Robert Williams? Which guards will be on the court during crunchtime? <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Derrick White</a> has been one of the Celtics’ two or three best players during a number of recent games but played only 59 seconds during the final six minutes of Saturday’s close win against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Philadelphia</a>. White had a great game that night with 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting. During the three-point victory, the Celtics outscored the 76ers by 25 points over his 25 minutes. Still, he watched most of the ending from the bench.</p><p>Regardless of whether that was the right call by Mazzulla, his lineup decisions won’t be easy. The Celtics have a long list of capable players. Not all of them will be able to close games or play every night. Grant Williams felt the reality of that Wednesday.</p><p>“Everybody is sacrificing to some extent at some points in the season,” Brown said. “This is a moment of adversity a little bit for Grant, and I know he is going to be able to respond well from it. He’s a good kid who adds value and a good guy in the locker room. We all are figuring out the moving pieces as we are getting ready for the playoffs and it’s a part of it, going on a journey right quick.”</p><p>(Photo of Caris LeVert of the Cavaliers trying to tie up Jayson Tatum during the fourth quarter Wednesday: Winslow Townson / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2ttcGxpa3xzfJFsZmlrX2V%2FcLPRmqWtZaeeua21wKaqZpyepXqkscutoJyrXay2r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
