However, a quick google search shows that Canadian newcomer, Leila, originally recorded the track “All Night” with Drake — same production, same rap verses as “Control,” — but in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia shared with VIBE how the record came to fruition. “The producers had sent it to us like ‘Yo, we think this would be a great record for her, Drake already has his verses down. What do you think?’ We didn’t have the chance to work together, but they sent it to me,” she says. “As soon as they sent it, I said ‘His verses are hot, let’s do it.’ And then they said ‘Everybody loves it, we’re going to make his vocals match yours since they weren’t recorded in the same studio’ and that was it.’<br>&nbsp;<br>Her manager explained that producer Special K had reached out two – three weeks ago with the track, pushing Olivia to record it quickly so it could also live on a Canadian compilation. “I knew I wasn’t going to pay $100,000 to get Drake on the album, but I was under the impression this was cleared for the mixtape. I was pissed off when they leaked it, you can check my Twitter. I was heated,” he says. “But its not that serious, it was for a damn mixtape. He can be mad all he wants to, I don’t give a fuck if he’s mad. I don’t represent him. He can be mad at the producer.”</p><p>She also agreed that Drake’s rebuttal was a bit of an overreaction: “Sorry Drake’s mad, ’cause I love [him]. But I’m not feenin’ to get on the thing and wild out.”<br><span><br>Olivia is currently prepping for her forthcoming mixtape, Under The Radar, and second album Show The World. DJ Special K did not respond to VIBE’s interview request. —Tracy Garraud<br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6S5qsLImmSrnaOlvK%2Bw0mabq5mbmnq0u9GrsGaxn6p6rq3DZmxraGFsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
