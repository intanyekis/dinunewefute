The league has had to make a plethora of changes to its 2020 season schedule due to the pandemic, and this had to include the canceling of an annual tradition.</p><p>Each of the last four Pro Bowls were played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. Before that, the game was usually played at Aloha Stadium in Halawa, Hawaii.</p><p>The 2015 Pro Bowl was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium (now State Farm Stadium) in Glendale, Arizona. Sun Life Stadium in Miami, Florida, hosted the 2010 Pro Bowl event.</p><p>With the 2021 Pro Bowl canceled, the league also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced </a>they'll "work closely with the NFLPA and other partners, to create a variety of engaging activities to replace the Pro Bowl game this season."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;New Orleans Will Host Super Bowl LIX Instead Of Super Bowl LVIII</a></strong></span></p><p>Allegiant Stadium is home to the Las Vegas Raiders, who relocated from Oakland this season. Before the start of the regular season, owner Mark Davis announced that there wouldn't be any fans in attendance for 2020.</p><p>So far, 15 of the 32 NFL teams have held a limited number of fans at their 2020 home games. The Dallas Cowboys - who opened up AT&T Stadium to approximately a 25 percent capacity - have averaged<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 23,958 fans</a> per contest through their first three home games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's still a wait-and-see thing for many other teams, who hope to eventually have fans in 2020. The Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are among the clubs who recently received approval to have some fans for their 2020 home games.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>David Schwimmer Still Thinks Ross & Rachel In "Friends" Were On A Break</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toppaheqStzZycpatdqbWmeZFpaWploKe8bq7OsKNmn5GisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
