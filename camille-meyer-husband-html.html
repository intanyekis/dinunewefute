She is now happily married to David C. Meyer. 
But 'happy' might not be the right word to describe her previous marriage, or at least its end.
Her more-than-a-decade-long marriage to ex husband Kelsey Grammer ended in 2011, but that did not stop the bad blood between the two. 
The former couple has made less-than-friendly remarks about each other even years after their marriage ended."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their Malibu wedding started a relationship that lasted for over 13 years.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During their time together, they had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two kids via surrogacy</a>. Their first kid, daughter Mason Olivia Grammer, was born on October 24, 2001. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jude Gordon Grammar, their son, followed his sister into the world on August 28, 2004.</p><p></p><p><strong>Camille Meyer with kids from her marriage with ex husband Kelsey Grammer.</strong> (Photo: Camille Meyer/Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But things started going downhill soon after, or at least that's what Kelsey has recounted.</p><p>During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Graham Bensinger</a> in 2019, Kelsey revealed how things had started getting bad with his then-wife Meyer.</p><p>He told Bensinger that Meyer chose a bad day to bring up divorce. Meyer apparently chose the day of Kelsey's mother's funeral to say she wanted a divorce. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, that wasn't the first time they had that conversation. "We'd had the same conversation for eight years, and it was tiresome," said Kelsey.</p><p>"I realized at that moment that I was done with her, that I was not going to end up in this relationship for much longer. And somewhere under a year [later], I was done."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This led straight to their divorce, which she initiated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Meyer <a href=# rel="follow noopener">filed for divorce</a> from her ex husband in June 2010. She demanded primary physical custody of their two children, child support, and alimony in the filings.</p><p>The couple did not have a prenup. So, she could have walked away with over $50 million, as she rejected the previous offer of a $30 million settlement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">divorce was finalized</a> in February 2011, but their dispute over money and custody was only officially concluded in December 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Camille Meyer and Kelsey Grammer Had Bad Blood</h2><p>A few months before Meyer filed for divorce from Kelsey, she had become a part of the inaugural season of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She became a big name overnight. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But with her growing name also came troubles for her marriage. During the same time, Kelsey had gone away to work on Broadway for a year.</p><p>There, he met another woman, a British flight attendant, Kayte Walsh.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And Kelsey apparently told her he wanted the marriage to be done over a phone call.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she did not hold back</a> when talking about her ex husband in 2014. During an interview with Andy Cohen, he said some unsavory things about him and his behavior towards her.</p><p>When Cohen asked if he spoke to her at the time, Meyer responded in the negative.</p><p>She also commented on how "terrible" co-parenting with him was, and said, "He has to learn to love his kids more than he hates me." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They hadn't even had a conversation without a mediator since their divorce.</p><p>It was now Kelsey's turn to respond. And he did, albeit after five years.</p><p>In the same interview with Bensinger in 2019, he also commented on what he thought about his ex wife's actions regarding him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Honestly, I don't really talk about her very much, because so much of her life is spent talking about me," quipped Kelsey. "I just think it's sort of pathetic."</p><p>Then came the above comments about Meyer being insensitive towards him and his mother.</p><p>The RHOBH star, however, strongly denied that she had done anything of that sort.</p><p>In a statement she made on Twitter on November 14, 2019, she revealed that Kelsey's recounting of the events were not true in the slightest.</p><p>She detailed what had happened during the days of his mom's funeral and accused him of "rewriting history" at the end of the statement.</p><p>A year prior to this, she had also opened up on how he used to act like she did not exist and performed inappropriate behavior in front of their kids.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Camille Meyer's Relationship with Current Husband</h2><p>Five years after her nuptials with Kelsey had officially ended, Meyer met&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her current&nbsp;husband</a>, David C. Meyer. They first encountered each other in 2016 in Malibu.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>They got engaged in 2017 and got married a year later, in 2018, in a beautiful ceremony at a private beach club in Hawaii.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They do not have kids together yet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRoratuMRmpJ6xlad6qcHSm5innF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
