She learned Russian by watching TV shows in her formative years and through interactions with her childhood friends who spoke that language. She eventually learned English after moving to the United States in 2005.</li><li>Similar to how she learned Russian in Moldova, she learned Spanish in the United States by watching several telenovelas and mingling with Hispanic colleagues at her workplace. Italian, self-admittedly, is her weakest suit and she has tried to constantly work on mastering the language by talking with her brother who lives in Italy.</li><li>In December 2019, she made a YouTube video where she spoke in 16 different languages.</li><li>She had felt the calming effects of ASMR through multiple experiences in her childhood but did not know what exactly it was. After watching the videos of several YouTubers who work in the field, she decided to start a channel of her own to pass on the therapeutic experience of ASMR to as many people as she could.</li><li>After moving to Las Vegas from Moldovia, she worked at casinos for several years.</li><li>In addition to all the languages that she is already fluent in, it is one of her stated aims to learn French as well and make some videos in that language too.</li><li>She exercises 3-4 times a week and stays away from fast food, sodas, etc. However, she admitted that she is more or less addicted to cakes, sweets, and candies, and calls them her ‘drugs’.</li><li>In a YouTube video, she mentioned that not learning how to cook from her mother was one of her biggest regrets.</li><li>She herself uses ASMR whenever she is trying to fall asleep. Even in her daily routine, while she is working on anything at home, she keeps videos of her favorite ASMR artists running in the background.</li><li>In another YouTube video, she revealed that one of her fans had sent her a request to send them her favorite pair of shoes. The fan mentioned that he/she wanted to eat those shoes and would pay for the experience. She immediately blocked that fan from all her social media platforms.</li><p>Featured Image by TerraDiASMR / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq2cq6qRmbaiv8yrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
