With that being said, to sum things up, here's what her life looked like before becoming Catwoman.</p><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-rose-to-fame-in-2011><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz Rose To Fame In 2011</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zoë Kravitz grew up in an artistic family, especially as the daughter of legendary singer Lenny Kravitz and Primetime Emmy-nominated actress Lisa Bonet. It took her a while to adjust to Hollywood's working pace, but in 2011, the actress finally made her breakthrough thanks to her portrayal of, Angel Salvadore, a mutant with dragonfly wings tatted on her body, in X-Men: First Class. She ended up amassing a Breakout Actress nomination at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards, which was the start of something special.</p><p>"The only thing is that it kind of hurts after a while because it's straining you, pretty much. But it's really fun, and you're zooming around the room. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's the closest I'll ever get to flying, so it's pretty cool</a>," she recalled her time filming the movie in an interview with IGN.</p><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-39-s-portrayal-of-bonnie-carlson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz's Portrayal Of Bonnie Carlson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a series of successful stints in box office hits, including Divergent and its sequels, Good Kill, Mad Max: Fury Road, and the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Zoë elevated her success to a whole new level with HBO's drama Big Little Lies alongside big names like Nicole Kidman, Alexander Skarsgård, and Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>Her portrayal of Bonnie Carlson in the series ended up landing her two Black Reel Award nominations as an individual and a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Drama Series as a collective.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest Stars To Play Batman Villains Over The Years</a></span></p><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-served-as-executive-producer-for-hulu-39-s-39-high-fidelity-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz Served As Executive Producer For Hulu's 'High Fidelity'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later on, in 2020, Zoë made her comeback to the Black Reel Awards. This time, the actress won an award for Outstanding Writing for her Hulu hit High Fidelity, which she shared with fellow screenwriter E.T. Feigenbaum. The series, starring the actress herself, drew inspiration from the 2000 film of the same name in which her mother starred. Although the series was a critical success, Hulu axed it in August 2020 after just one season.</p><p>"I read the book in my early twenties. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I fell in love with the movie, and fell deeper in love with the world through the book</a>. It just allows your imagination to go even further, and Nick Hornby’s tone and language are so wonderful," she told Rolling Stone, "There was something more romantic about it when I was younger, about this character that just couldn’t get it together, and the way that Rob saw the world, and saw herself, himself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-voiced-catwoman-in-2017><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz Voiced Catwoman In 2017</span></h2><p>The Batman wasn't the first time the actress had been involved with the anti-heroine.

The film was a big success, amassing $312 million out of its $80 million production budget.</p><p>"I also tried to think about it not as Catwoman, but as a woman; how does this make me feel? How are we approaching this, and how are we making sure we’re not fetishizing or creating a stereotype? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I knew it needed to be a real person,</a>" the actress told AnOther Magazine about the creative process of her character portrayal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Robert Pattinson Hate Filming 'The Batman'?</a></span></p><h2 id=zo-euml-kravitz-voiced-mary-jane-in-39-into-the-spider-verse-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz Voiced Mary Jane In 'Into the Spider-Verse'</span></h2><p>Zoë also crossed the DC-Marvel rivalry by taking the role of Mary Jane in Spider-Man: Into the Verse.
