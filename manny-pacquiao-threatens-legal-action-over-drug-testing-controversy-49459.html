Shortly after the news broke, Golden Boy Promotions’ Richard Schaefer said he was told that Pacquiao doesn’t want to undergo the blood tests, because of superstition and it’d distrupt his training. Pacquiqo did, however, say he’d have his blood drawn before the kick-off press conference and immediately after the fight</p><p>“Todd told me that Pacquiao has difficulty with taking blood and doesn’t want to do it so close to the fight,” said Schaefer. “He, Pacquiao, would only agree to have blood drawn before the kick-off press conference and after the fight.”</p><p>Mayweather struck back with a statement saying Pacquiao’s decision looks bad.</p><p>“In a fight of this magnitude, I think it is our responsibility to subject ourselves to sportsmanship at the highest level. I have already agreed to the testing and it is a shame that he is not willing to do the same,” he said. “It leaves me with great doubt as to the level of fairness I would be facing in the ring that nightI hope that this is either some miscommunication or that Manny will change his mind and step up and allow these tests, which were good enough for all these other great athletes, to be performed by USADA.”</p><p>Now, with all the controversy swirling following the war of words between the two camps, Pacquiao released a statement on his personal website, saying he’d be filing a case “as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Enough is enough. These people — Mayweather Sr, Jr, and Golden Boy Promotions — think it is a joke and a right to accuse someone wrongly of using steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs,” the statement began. “I have tried to just brush it off as a mere pre-fight ploy, but I think they have gone overboard.</p><p>“I have instructed my promoter, Bob Arum, head of Top Rank Inc, to help me out in the filing of the case as soon as possible because I have had people coming over to me now asking if I really take performance-enhancing drugs and I have cheated my way into becoming the number one boxer in the world.”</p><p>As the statement continued, Pacquaio cleared up rumors over possible drug use, saying he’s never used any type of steroids or anything else in his training, and will never use them.</p><p>“I maintain and assure everyone that I have not used any form or kind of steroids and that my way to the top is a result of hard work, hard work, hard work and a lot of blood spilled from my past battles in the ring, not outside of it,” Pacquiao said. “I have no idea what steroids look like and my fear in God has kept me safe and victorious through all these years.”</p><p>Pacquiao’s trainer Freddie Roach added that the demands of Mayweather are not necessary under the rules governing fights in Nevada, calling them minds games.</p><p>“We have passed every test ever given to us. We go by the commission rules, since when does the fighter make up the rules?, ” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kur7rYZqeam6GqtqK7jK2fq52RqbKvv4ylnKCZnGKupMDIqKVmp6aav26w0a6eZqyVqMGqusZmmqimpKe8t7HRrLBmbGlpgnp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
