A large portion of his immense fortune was initially intended to be used to fund a scholarship program for unfortunate families in South Carolina and Georgia.</p><p>Though - thanks majorly to the singer's partner&nbsp;Tomi Rae Hynie - this didn't go quite as the 'Godfather of Soul' planned. Hynie, a singer who claimed to be Brown's last wife, was more than shocked to find that neither her name or that of her son's were found on Brown's will. Seeing as how her marriage to the star was not entirely recognized by law, she returned to Brown's South Carolina home to find that she was locked out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the court listed the estate to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">be worth</a> somewhere between six to nine figures, lawsuits were bandied out by a number of individuals trying to get a fraction of it. Hynie was a frontrunner in the court's eyes to receive a portion and in 2009, a settlement was made by then attorney general&nbsp;Henry McMaster for her to get a quarter of his estate. Half was intended to go towards the scholarship charity and the remainder would go to the rest of his family.</p><p>Though, the ruling was eventually overturned four years later, as the settlement did not properly fulfill Brown's intentions for the scholarship program that was listed in his will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hynie's endeavors of getting her hands on the Brown estate were thwarted once again last year, when her marriage with the singer was called into question. According to <a href=#>Associated Press News</a>, she, "failed to annul a previous marriage." Because she was never legally married to Brown, she had no rights to any of his assets.</p><p>Earlier this month, a presumably final settlement was made. Brown's estate attorney David Black broke the news on Friday, though specific details have yet to be disclosed.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>George Clooney Faces Legal Battle Over $9.8 Million Wine Estate In Provence</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Associated Press News</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3ornErGSbqp%2Bsu26ywKagpbFdqLK1wMueZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
