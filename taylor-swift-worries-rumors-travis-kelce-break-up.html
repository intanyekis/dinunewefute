Leading up to the event, there was all sorts of speculation that Travis would go all out. One report claimed he was planning a big party with her friends and family.</p><p>However, the singer’s birthday came and went. <a href=#>Taylor celebrated by going out in New York</a> with a slew of famous friends, but Travis was nowhere in sight. Not only did this debunk rumors he was doing something big for her birthday, but it caused speculation that something was amiss between the two, which is evidence of how scrutiny Taylor and Travis’ relationship is under.</p><p>“It’s been a whirlwind between her concerts, his football games, and meeting each other’s parents and friends,” the insider continued. “Now that they’re coming down to earth a little, there appears to be trouble ahead.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source emphasized that trouble could be brewing ahead. “But the hard conversations are coming up,” they continued. “For one thing, they’ve had to deal with nasty rumors.”</p><h2 id=taylor-doesn-rsquo-t-believe-the-rumors-being-spread-about-travis>Taylor Doesn’t Believe The Rumors Being Spread About Travis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg><p>As excited as many fans are to see Taylor in a new relationship, it hasn’t been without controversy. Travis’ past comment shave been brought up, including references he made to wanting to find a “breeder” – aka. a woman to have children with – during an episode of his podcast that aired earlier this year before their relationship, which some fans have called distasteful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis has also been accused of having a history of infidelity. His ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Kayla Nicole issued a public warning to Taylor</a> when speaking to Daily Mail in the summer. Not only did Kayla say that Travis cheated on her, but she warned the pop singer to be wary of his intentions.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t065511-258.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Inside Look At Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Parents</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the many health struggles her parents have faced, Andrea and Scott Swift always prioritized Taylor's dreams and passion for music.</span><p>“While Taylor doesn’t believe any of it,” the source told Life and Style. “it’s still hard to ignore and creates some tension between her and Travis.”</p><p>There have even been reports that people close to Taylor are telling her to be cautious. One <a href=#>report says her friend Selena Gomez is unsure</a> of Travis, while another claimed that Gigi Hadid was suspicious, though the model <a href=#>later publicly refuted the allegations</a> .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis and Taylor have also had to deal with speculation over her past relationship. For instance, earlier this month, <a href=#>the singer’s rep shut down an allegation</a> made by Instagram gossip account Deux Moi that claimed she married Joe Alwyn in secret during their six-year relationship, which ended at the start of this year.</p><p>Needless to say, Taylor and Travis have a lot of media attention to navigate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lp6S%2Fs7XErGSrrZ2kv7R506uYr6GjYrimuMKeZJuqlZa4bsHPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
