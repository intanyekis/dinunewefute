Not much has been heard of the reality TV star in recent months, and now it has become clear to fans that it's because she had no real reason to ever leave her luxurious home. Nestled in the very highly esteemed area of Star Island, Miami, Lea's mansion is every bit as elaborate as the neighborhood's name suggests.</p><p>Lea and her husband, defense attorney Roy Black, have been quietly living their best lives in one of the most truly admired neighborhoods that most people could only ever dream of. Their home can now be yours, if $34 million is within budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ,</a> this 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion is centralized in an area that is "home to&nbsp;Alex Rodriguez, Diddy, Shaquille O'Neal, Naomi Campbell, Gloria and Emilio Estefan," and that's just to name a few.

In fact, the Blacks spent a fortune renovating and re-renovating the home during their 11 year ownership of the property, and the modern state of the sprawling estate are certainly reflective of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home is a 10,636-square-foot extravagant mansion with oversized rooms, expensive detailing, state-of-the-art appliances, and an abundance of luxuries. It comes equipped with an oversized pool which can be seen from any one of the multiple verandas that overlook the enormous property.</p><p>Also visible from the terraces are the 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom guest house which is nicer than most mansions inhabited by other celebrities.</p><p>The size of the property is an enormous 46,429 square feet, which as TMZ reports, "includes 190 feet of waterfront and a full dock tucked away from visitors on boat tours who want a peek into celebrity life."</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gene Simmons Kissing California Goodbye, Buys Vegas Mansion For $8.2 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fpq3LZp%2BoraOaxKrCxKxkpqGRorZuuMSaZJukkZi4brnAp6qip55igHV5zKKjpaGfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
