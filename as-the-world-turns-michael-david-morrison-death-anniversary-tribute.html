The cause of the 33-year-old’s death? Acute intoxication caused by the combination of ethanol, cocaine and opiates, according to a report published by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>Even now, our eyes widen in shock at the memory. There remain so many unanswered questions. Morrison and wife Amy McDonald were raising a 2-year-old. And his star was only beginning to rise on As the World Turns, where he was half of a budding supercouple with Susan Marie Snyder, who played Julie Wendell.</p><p>In 2011, the actress recalled for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Santa Barbara Online</a> that after her leading man’s sudden passing, the producers “replaced him the next day. That was pretty traumatic. The part of me that made Julie real was deeply in love with the part of Michael that played Caleb.</p><p>“It was very difficult,” she added, “to separate that out.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>We can only imagine.
