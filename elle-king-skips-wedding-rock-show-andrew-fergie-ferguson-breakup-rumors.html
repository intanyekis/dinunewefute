But I haven’t seen my sugar in a month,” she captioned the video. “Lately I don’t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She’s my best friend and the only true loyalty I’ve ever known.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself,” she continued. “But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don’t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts. Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you’re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A rep for King did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeVobmmecqipaBlo6C2sb%2BMsJydnJmjtG6%2BzpyiZquYpMRurc2dqZ6vXZuys7PInmSfnaKcwrS7zWaZq52RoMKxedGupKiqo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
