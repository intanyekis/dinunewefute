Despite having a lackluster review from the critics, Eternals continues to slay the box office, generating millions of sales from over 4000 theaters. The movie grossed $71 million on its opening weekend. With the addition of the grosses over the weekend, the film officially crossed the $100 million domestically, making it <a href=#>one of the few movies ever to earn</a> over $100 million in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film is directed by the Oscar winner Chloe Zhao and features big stars Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, and Angelina Jolie. Though the 2nd week of Eternals fell about 61% from their debut week, it is still a success considering the film already made $281.4 million globally as of the moment. It is not uncommon for a superhero movie to drop sales from the 2nd week; the previous Disney and Marvel movies Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings dropped 52% on sales on its 2nd week. Both movies played exclusively in the theaters; their only difference is that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings got good reviews from the critics while Eternals fell short on it. Eternals follows the movie <a href=#>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings </a>as the theatrical-only release for Marvel. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings are currently streaming on Disney+ after it left the theater.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Chinese Film 'The Battle at Lake Changjin' Grossed $633 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>Clifford the Big Red Dog, which opened in the theaters during the week, comes 2nd place to Eternals.
