And I’m not sure, it wasn’t my idea, but someone in creative came up with it, and they really decided that would be something really, really good, with the mirrors and my physique. Definitely wasn’t my idea.”</p><p>Luger also touched a bit on his first WrestleMania match against Curt Hennig. Luger discussed how relaxed he was prior to the match, but quickly had to improvise once the match got underway. “We got in the ring, and I knew Curt had a reputation of being a ribber, like pull pranks, but we got in the ring, we locked up and he goes ‘What are we doing, what are we doing?’” he said. “I thought he was joking around, but he apologized afterwards, Curt told me – I don’t know whether he was still ribbing me or not – but he said he completely blanked out. So we ended up having an okay match.” Luger said he ended up “calling” the match between the two, leading the way as it went. Now, though, Luger said he looks back on it as a funny moment between the two.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBqb21qZWK5psSMpaygnaJiwamxjKeYq5uZqMCqv9KtZKmdoqi8r62MnZyfoZ6ewaa42GaumqueqXquxYyim56Z</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
