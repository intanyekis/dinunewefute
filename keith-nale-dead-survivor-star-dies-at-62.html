While he never became a core member of a long-term alliance,&nbsp;Keith&nbsp;managed to make it all the way to the final four before being voted out one day before the Final Tribal&nbsp;Council. He returned to the game <a href=#>the following year for Survivor: Cambodia</a>, where he progressed until castmate <strong>Kelley Wentworth</strong> won immunity and he was sent home for a second time.</p><p class=p1>Following news of his death, Keith’s former Survivor castmates took to social media to mourn the loss of their costar.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Keith – a man with the purest heart, who brought humor into moments where it was needed most,” Wentworth, who competed alongside Keith in both San Juan del Sur and Cambodia, <a href=#>wrote via Twitter</a> on Tuesday. “I’m grateful I had the opportunity to meet Keith & share memories together on the beaches of Nicaragua & Cambodia. My heart is with the entire Nale family. This is a devastating loss.”</p><p class=p1><strong>Jeremy Collins</strong>, for his part — who also starred alongside the former fire captain in both games — tweeted: “My <a href=#>condolences to the Big D, Wes, Austin and entire Nale family</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be missed Keith but your legacy will live on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest in power my firefighter/survivor brother. #RIPOtis.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>While the Louisiana native wasn’t known for his strategy,<a href=#> he became a fan&nbsp;favorite player </a>and prided himself on playing an honest game. In December 2014. After he was sent home from San Juan del Sur, Keith opened up about competing in his 50s&nbsp;alongside much younger castmates.</p><p>“They were impressed, being I was 53. Now granted that’s not 93, but that’s not 23 either,” the reality show alum<b>&nbsp;</b>shared during an interview with <a href=#>UpRoxx&nbsp;</a>at the time.&nbsp;“And I said ‘Man, they were impressed with some of the challenges.’ They said, ‘Man,&nbsp;I couldn’t have hung on that pole for an hour and a half.’ They were all behind me, a great bunch of guys. They wanted me to win it and, you know, bring it home to Louisiana. But that just didn’t happen.”</p><p>He continued: “But hey, I got a bunch of texts last night. …. They said,&nbsp;‘Fourth place is great, but you’re so close you can see it, you know what I mean.’ I want to say, ‘Well heck, I’d rather come in&nbsp;10th than fourth or I’d rather come in&nbsp;15th than fourth,’ but not really. You just feel like that at the moment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When he returned to Cambodia for season 31, Keith explained why he chose to return to the physically demanding reality series.</p><p>“When do you get a second chance for something crazy like this?” he told cameras during a 2015 episode. “People ask me if Survivor is fun. I tell ‘em,&nbsp;‘Hell, no!&nbsp;Survivor ain’t fun. Going on a cruise is fun. You know, going fishing is fun. Going to play golf is fun. This ain’t fun. I mean, look at me. Golly!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZmptW66wKWcZpyVlrFuv9SrraKun6d6tMDAq2SdoZWoeqLAjG9paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
