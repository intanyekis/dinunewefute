Many fans recently speculated that the pop superstar, 26, had a boob job after she was photographed spilling out of a crimson top while leaving a Selena Gomez concert in Nashville with boyfriend Tom Hiddleston on June 21. The Grammy winner added fuel to the fire when she shared photos of herself looking curvier than ever in an array of patriotic swimsuits at her star-studded Fourth of July bash in Rhode Island."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I just hope girls can learn to accept themselves, whatever they look like, however big or small their breasts are,” the <i>Modern Family</i> star, 18, said on Tuesday. “And even, I have to say, you know, even if Taylor Swift did get her boobs done, good for her if she felt like she wanted to.”</p><p>In addition to sticking up for Swift, Winter, a proud body-positivity advocate, also spoke about the ridicule she faced after she made the brave choice to flaunt her surgery scars on the red carpet for the 2016 SAG Awards back in January.</p><p><span>“It can destroy a person,” she explained, “and I think it’s disgusting that’s what people spend time on.”</span></p><p><span>In response to body shamers, Winter has learned to clap back when necessary. Most recently, she shut down online trolls who criticized her for showing what was, in their eyes, too much skin at her high school graduation party. The actress, who slipped into a skintight mini (with an underboob-baring cutout) for the celebration, took to Instagram to put her haters in their place.<br></span></p><p>“Dear sorry body-shamers, I looked HOT in that dress. And if you hate it, don’t buy it. But please get a hobby,” she wrote on Wednesday, June 22. “XOXO Ariel #EmbraceYourBody.”</p><p>Watch the video above.</p><p>Ian Drew and Travis Cronin dished on all the latest on this story during <i></i><i></i><a href=#><i>Us Weekly’s</i> Facebook Live News Update</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaaqpmauW7DyKernqpdnrNuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZp6orF2WeqO7zptko6eSYrSwu8NmnaiqXZ2ys3nWa2hsaGFpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
